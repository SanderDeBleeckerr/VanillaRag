["Steam Deck\n\nThe Steam Deck is a handheld gaming computer produced by Valve Corporation, designed to run the large library of games available on the Steam storefront client. Built upon the experiences gained from Valve's earlier ventures with Steam Machine and the Steam Controller, the Steam Deck integrates a custom AMD APU and SteamOS, a Linux-based operating system. The Steam Deck represents Valve's pivot towards a fully in-house hardware development approach, following the challenges faced with Steam Machines' reliance on OEMs and the requirement for native Linux game support.\nSince its release in February 2022, the Steam Deck has garnered significant attention for its widespread adoption and versatility, including support for both native Linux games and those running through Proton, a compatibility layer for Windows games. Additionally, the Steam Deck features a desktop mode and allows users to install third-party Linux applications. The device has seen multiple revisions, including the introduction of OLED screen models in November 2023. Despite criticism regarding battery life, the Steam Deck has achieved notable commercial success, selling millions of units and influencing the market with its approach to portable gaming, and has spurred interest in similar handheld gaming computers.\nHistory.\nValve's Steam Machine series of gaming computers using Linux-based SteamOS was introduced in 2015, which worked their way into the conception of the Steam Deck. Valve quietly pulled back on it by April 2018, but stated they remained committed to providing some type of open-hardware platform. Steam Deck designer Scott Dalton said \"there was always kind of this classic chicken and egg problem with the Steam Machine\", as it required the adoption of Linux by both players and game developers to reach a critical interest in the machines to draw manufacturers in making them. The lack of Linux game availability during the lifetime of Steam Machines led Valve to invest development into Proton, a Linux compatibility layer to allow Windows\u2013based games to be run on Linux without modification.\nSome of the early prototypes of Valve's Steam Controller, also released in 2015, included a small LCD screen within the middle of the controller which could be programmed as a second screen alongside the game that the user was playing. One idea from this prototype was to include the Steam Link, a device capable of streaming game content from a computer running Steam to a different monitor, here routing that output to the small LCD on the controller. This was later considered by Valve a very early concept behind the Steam Deck. Furthermore, their experience with trying to convince other manufacturers to produce Steam Machines led Valve to realize that it was better to develop all their hardware internally. Dalton said, \"More and more it just became kind of clear, the more of this we are doing internally, the more we can kind of make a complete package.\" Rumors that Valve was working on a portable gaming unit had emerged in May 2021, based on updates made within the Steam code pointing towards a new \"SteamPal\" device, and comments made by Gabe Newell related to Valve developing games for consoles. \"Ars Technica\" had been able to confirm that new hardware was in development at Valve.\nValve revealed the Steam Deck on July 15, 2021. The Deck, existing in three different models based on internal storage options, was shipped starting in February 2022 in North America and Europe, with other regions to follow throughout the year. Valve's CEO, Gabe Newell, said of the Steam Deck's approach, \"As a gamer, this is a product I've always wanted. And as a game developer, it's the mobile device I've always wanted for our partners.\" According to Newell, they wanted to be \"very aggressive\" on the release and pricing strategy as they considered the mobile market as their primary competitor for the Deck. However, their focus was on the unit's performance; Newell stated, \"But the first thing was the performance and the experience, [that] was the biggest and most fundamental constraint that was driving this.\" Newell recognized that the base pricing was somewhat lower than expected and \"painful\", but necessary to meet the expectation of gamers who would want the Deck. Newell continued that he believed this was a new product category of personal computer hardware that Valve and other computer manufacturers would continue to participate in if the Steam Deck proved successful, and thus it was necessary to keep the unit's price point reasonable to demonstrate viability. The openness of the system was also a key feature according to Newell, as that is a defining \"superpower\" of the personal computer space over typical console systems. Newell did not want to have any limitations on what the end user could do with the hardware, such as installing alternate non-Steam software on it.\nAs of December 2022, Valve was pursuing improvements on the Steam Deck, including per-game \"power profiles\", and some other performance improvements, as well as evaluating a second generation Steam Deck. Valve was also considering bringing some of the Steam Deck technology into a new Steam Controller 2. Valve announced two new Deck models to be available for purchase in November 2023, both with OLED screens, extended battery capacity, and improved cooling features, among other hardware modifications to improve connectivity and efficiency; however, no changes were made to the Deck's overall performance. These models replace two of the existing models. Hardware designers for Valve stated that they would have wanted to include OLED screens for the original launch models, but at the time, OLED screens of sufficient size and quality did not yet exist on the market, and they would have had to delay release by 12 to 18 months if they went on that route. Alongside the announcement of the OLED models, Valve stated they are working towards a Steam Deck 2 with overall system improvements including the CPU and GPU chips, but these systems will likely not be ready for two to three years. System designer Lawrence Yang said they wanted to wait for a \"generational leap\" of CPUs with better computing power without significant power requirement increases before implementing a new version of the Steam Deck.\nHardware.\nLCD models.\nThe original Steam Deck was launched in February 2022 and included a custom AMD APU based on their Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architectures, named Aerith, after the \"Final Fantasy VII\" character Aerith Gainsborough. The CPU runs a four-core/eight-thread unit and the GPU runs on eight compute units with a total estimated performance of 1.6 TFLOPS. Both the CPU and GPU use variable timing frequencies, with the CPU running between 2.4 and 3.5\u00a0GHz and the GPU between 1.0 and 1.6\u00a0GHz based on current processor needs. Valve stated that the CPU has comparable performance to Ryzen 3000 desktop computer processors and the GPU performance to the Radeon RX 6000 series. The Deck includes 16\u00a0GB of LPDDR5 RAM in a quad-channel configuration, with a total bandwidth of 88\u00a0GB/s.\nThe Deck's main unit is designed for handheld use. It includes a touchscreen LCD display with a 1280\u00d7800 pixel resolution with a fixed 60\u00a0Hz refresh rate; games are configured to use vertical synchronization where possible. The unit's input set features two thumbsticks, a directional pad, ABXY buttons, two shoulder buttons on each side of the unit, four additional buttons on the rear of the unit, as well as two trackpads under each thumbstick. The thumbsticks and trackpads use capacitive sensing, and the unit further includes a gyroscope to allow for more specialized controls on the handheld mode. The unit also includes haptic feedback.\nThe Deck supports Bluetooth connectivity for input devices, including common game controllers, and includes integrated WiFi network support to meet IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac standards, stereo sound out via a digital signal processor, an integrated microphone and a headphone jack, a 40 watt-hour battery, which Valve estimates that for \"lighter use cases like game streaming, smaller 2D games, or web browsing\" can last between seven and eight hours. Valve also estimated that by keeping frame rates to around 30 frames per second (FPS) more intensive games such as \"Portal 2\" could be played for five to six hours. The system's software includes an optional FPS limiter that balance a game's performance to optimize battery life. At release, Steam Decks were only manufactured in a black casing to reduce the complexity of production, though Valve stated that they have considered introducing other case colors or themes in the future. Valve partnered with iFixit to provide replacement parts for users.\nThe unit shipped in three models based on internal storage options. The base model includes a 64\u00a0GB eMMC internal storage unit, running over PCI Express 2.0 x1. A mid-tier model includes 256\u00a0GB of storage through an NVMe SSD device, while the high-end unit includes a 512\u00a0GB NVMe SSD storage unit, with the latter two both shipping with drives that run PCI Express 3.0 x4. All 3 SKUs use the same M.2 2230 interface for internal storage. Valve stated that the built-in storage is not meant to be replaceable by end-users, though can be replaced as necessary for repair. Additional storage space is available through a microSD card slot, which also supports microSDXC and microSDHC formats.\nAs Valve considered options for bringing a handheld device to market, they set a priority that the device had to be able to play nearly the entirety of the Steam game catalogue, and rejected possible hardware that moved away from the standard x86-based processing structure that would have been easier to implement in handheld form but would have limited what games would be available. Only through recent discussions with AMD and their current product lines was Valve able to identify a technical approach that would meet the goal of a handheld device capable of playing all Steam games without overtaxing the processor unit. The developers considered the Steam Deck to be future-proof. While the specifications are modest compared to high-end gaming computers, they felt that the performance was at a good place that would be acceptable for many years, while still looking at newer software improvements, such as the addition of AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). Though they do not have any current designs for a successor, Valve stated that there would likely be future iterations of the hardware in years to come, but the company expects the timing of releases to depend on the current state of processor technology and handheld device limitations rather than a regular upgrade cycle.\nOLED models.\nTwo new models were released on November 16, 2023. These models, with 512\u00a0GB and 1\u00a0TB of internal storage come in to replace the previous top of the line LCD variant. The 64\u00a0GB and 512\u00a0GB original units are now discontinued, with the 256\u00a0GB LCD version becoming the new base model. The new model upgrades include a larger OLED 90\u00a0Hz display, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support, a battery with an estimated 25% improvement in capacity, and improved cooling. The OLED deck includes a revised APU based on 6\u00a0nm processor production named Sephiroth, also based on the \"Final Fantasy VII\" character. In addition, a limited edition of the 1\u00a0TB model was released in North America exclusively, which has translucent plastic casing and selected orange colored components.\nDock unit.\nA dock unit was released on October 6, 2022. The dock unit can be connected to an external power source to power the Deck, and to an external monitor via either HDMI or DisplayPort protocols to route output from the Deck to that monitor. Though limited by the processor speed, the display output from the Deck via the dock can reach as high as 8k resolution at 60\u00a0Hz or 4k resolution at 120\u00a0Hz; this resolution boost can also be achieved by attaching the Deck directly through a USB to HDMI adapter without the use of the docking station. There is no other change in performance of the Steam Deck whether docked or when used in portable mode. With SteamOS update 3.5.5, the dock unit was also made to support variable refresh rate monitors. The dock also supports Ethernet network connectivity and support for USB connections for controllers or other input devices. The Deck can also work with any third-party docking station that supports similar types of interfacing for portable devices. External GPUs are not officially supported, although testing via the M2 slot has demonstrated that eGPUs are capable of running when connected to the Deck.\nSoftware.\nOperating system.\nSteam Deck runs SteamOS version 3, based on the Arch Linux operating system. While SteamOS had been previously developed for Steam Machines using Debian Linux, Valve stated that they wanted to use a rolling upgrade approach for the Deck's system software, a function Debian was not designed for, but which is a characteristic of Arch Linux.\nAn application programming interface (API) specific for the Steam Deck is available to game developers, allowing a game to specify certain settings if it is being run on a Steam Deck compared to a normal computer. Within the Steam storefront, developers can populate a special file depot for their game with lower-resolution textures and other reduced elements to allow their game to perform better on the Steam Deck; Steam automatically detects and downloads the appropriate files for the system (whether on a computer or Steam Deck) when the user installs the game.\nInterface.\nThe Steam client on the Deck features a revised interface and functions different from the desktop client. Unlike Steam's Big Picture mode which was designed for use on television screens, which was treated as a separate software branch within Valve, the Deck version of the Steam client stays consistent with the desktop version, adding functions and interface elements to make navigating through Steam easier with controller input, and indicators typical for portable systems such as battery life and wireless connectivity. Valve replaced the previous Big Picture mode in Steam with one based on the Steam Deck user interface in February 2023. The version of Steam on the Deck otherwise supports all other functions of Steam, including user profiles and friends lists, access to game communities, cloud saving, Steam Workshop support, and the Remote Play feature.\nRemote Play allows the Steam Deck to be used as a controller for a game running on a computer, providing additional control options beyond traditional keyboard and mouse or common controller systems. The Steam software on the Deck also supports suspending a game in progress, a feature considered by Valve to be core to the Deck. Otherwise, games that do not take advantage of the Steam Deck API have the handheld's controller input automatically converted for them. For example, the touch-sensitive controllers on the Deck translate input appropriately for games that typically rely on keyboard and mouse controls. Valve added to Steam's current approach to cloud saving with the introduction of Dynamic Cloud Sync in January 2022. Prior cloud functionality only synchronized game saves after the user has exited a game; developers can enable Dynamic Cloud Sync to use cloud saving while the game is running, making this feature more amenable for portable use on the Steam Deck.\nGames.\nThe Deck displays compatible games from the Steam storefront. Games developed for Linux run natively. The SteamOS software includes support for Proton, a compatibility layer that allows games developed for Windows to be played on the Linux-based SteamOS. According to ProtonDB, a community-run database that compiles information on game compatibility of Steam games within Linux using Proton, several of Steam's more popular game releases were not yet compatible with Proton primarily due to anti-circumvention and anti-cheat controls or digital rights management (DRM). Valve stated they were working with vendors of these middleware solutions to improve Proton support while also encouraging Linux-specific versions to be developed. Epic Games' Easy Anti-Cheat, one of the more popular anti-cheat options for developers, was made available for macOS and Linux systems in September 2021, which Epic stated that developers could easily transition for the Proton layer. Valve worked with Epic over the end of 2021 to make the transition of Easy Anti-Cheat to Proton simple for developers. Another popular anti-cheat solution, BattlEye, also affirmed their software was ready to work with the Proton layer and only required developers to opt-in to enable it. Valve stated that in testing games otherwise currently available on Linux or compatible with the Proton layer, they had yet to find a game that failed to meet a minimum 30 frames-per-second performance on the handheld, a performance metric comparable to the consoles of the eighth generation. The Proton layer includes support for AMD's upscaling technology FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR); while Proton also supports Nvidia's DLSS upscaling solution, it is not compatible with the Deck.\nDue to potential confusion on game compatibility, Valve introduced a process in October 2021 by which they brought in additional staff to review games on Steam to make sure a game is fully playable on the Steam Deck. Games that are confirmed to be compatible with the Steam Deck, including those with Proton and any middleware DRM solutions, that by default meet minimum performance specifications, are marked as \"\". Games that may require some user tinkering with settings, such as having to use a system control to bring up the on-screen keyboard, are tagged as \"Playable\". Another category, \"Unsupported\", are games that Valve has tested to not be fully compatible with the Steam Deck, such as VR games, games using Windows-specific codecs that have not yet been made compatible with Proton or software apps. These ratings are to change over time as both the Steam Deck software improves as well as updates made by developers to games to improve compatibility with the Steam Deck software.\nUsers download games onto the Steam Deck to store on either the internal storage or SD card, each storage device treated as a separate Steam Library for games. This allows SD cards with different Steam Libraries to be swapped in and out. Valve is exploring the ability to pre-load games on an SD card outside of the Deck, such as through a personal computer. The ability to download games onto the Steam Deck from a local network Steam installation was added in February 2023. While the Deck was designed for playing games on the Steam storefront, desktop mode allows for installation of third-party storefronts like Epic Games Store, Ubisoft Connect, or Origin. It is possible to replace SteamOS with a different operating system entirely or set up multi-booting. It is also possible to use Microsoft Edge for Xbox Cloud Gaming, allowing those with Xbox Game Pass subscriptions access to that catalogue of games. Newell stated that Valve would support Microsoft in bringing Xbox Game Pass to Steam and Steam Deck if they want that route. With the system's open nature, users have also been able to add emulators to run games that users own from other consoles or computer systems.\nDesktop interface and third-party utilities.\nThe Deck's operating system can also be launched into desktop mode, which uses the KDE Plasma desktop environment with an immutable file system. A range of third-party software tools have been developed to bring additional utility to the device, typically installed through the desktop mode on the deck. Examples include SteamOS plugin loader Decky, emulation manager EmuDeck and the batocera.linux distribution.\nThe Steam Deck was used as a remote control for animatronics at Walt Disney World. It was also used for remote-operated gun turrets by Ukrainian forces defending positions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nRelease.\nPre-orders for the Steam Deck were opened a day after its announcement. Pre-orders were limited to those with Steam accounts opened before June 2021, to prevent resellers from depleting stock and making the device more difficult to purchase. First-day pre-order reservations through the Steam storefront briefly crashed the servers due to the demand. By September 2021, development kits for the Steam Deck were shipping to developers. For the planned release in Asian regions, Valve worked with Komodo to help with local production, localization, and distribution support.\nThe Steam Deck was released on February 25, 2022, in North America and the European regions. In Europe, it retailed from \u20ac419 onwards, between in the United Kingdom, from 4,300 kr in Denmark and between 3,987\u20134,219 z\u0142 in Poland. As part of the Steam Deck's launch, Valve released \"Aperture Desk Job\", a spinoff game in the \"Portal\" series, for free on March 1, 2022, available to all Windows and Linux/SteamOS users. The game is a \"de facto\" technology demonstration designed to show off the features of the Steam Deck, though it is still playable with an external controller. To assist in developing and testing software for the Steam Deck, Valve released SteamOS Devkit Client and Server under open-source licenses. Drivers for Windows are provided by Valve and AMD, but Valve does not provide support for them. During the first few days of release, Newell himself directly delivered some of the first Steam Deck units to residents in the Seattle area.\nDue to its popularity, some pre-order purchasers were informed that later shipments of the 64\u00a0GB model and 256\u00a0GB NVMe models would be in Q2 2022 and the 512\u00a0GB NVMe model by Q3 2022. Valve informed pre-purchasers in November 2021 that due to the ongoing global chip shortage, the device would fail to ship by December and instead would ship in February 2022, retaining the same order for delivery based on pre-order placement.\nBy June 2022, Valve stated they were able to double the number of Steam Decks shipping out each week, helping to meet the initial reservations, and by August 2022, Valve's production was outpacing expectations, allowing them to send out Steam Decks to consumers that were originally anticipated to ship in the final quarter of the year. Valve was able to fulfil all reservations by October 2022, opening the Steam Deck to purchase without reservation, though Valve tentatively will return to a reservation system should demand be too high. In December 2022, the Steam Deck was officially released for sale in Asia. In October 2024, Valve announced that after 2 years since its release the Steam Deck will be made officially available to the Australian market from November. It was released on November 19 retailing for between .\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nThe initial reaction to the announcement of the Steam Deck was positive. Epic Games' Tim Sweeney and Xbox Game Studios' Phil Spencer complimented Valve on the Steam Deck, with Sweeney calling it an \"amazing move by Valve!\" Spencer congratulated Valve \"on getting so many of us excited to be able to take our games with us wherever we decide to play\".\nMany outlets compared the unit to that of the Nintendo Switch, generally recognized as the first true hybrid video game console. Valve stated that they did not really consider the Switch in designing the Deck, as they \"tried to make all the decisions really in Steam Deck that targeted that audience and that served the customers that were already having a good time interacting with the games that are on that platform, on our platform\", and that by happenstance, came out with a device that was similar in function to the Switch. \"The Verge\" stated that the Steam Deck was generally a more powerful machine compared to the Switch but that power came with a tradeoff in battery life which was greater with the Switch. Furthermore, \"The Verge\" recognized that the specifications of the Deck were more comparable to the power of the consoles of the eighth generation like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, though using more recent compute/micro- and graphics architectures than that which powered those older systems. \"Kotaku\" stated that while the Deck and Switch may be similar in concept, the two were not competing devices due to their target demographics, with the Switch aimed more at a broad audience machine, while the Deck was geared towards more \"hardcore\" gamers. \"Digital Foundry\" noted that while the Deck's hardware may be more powerful, game developers only developing games for the Windows operating system are not necessarily able to get low-level access to the CPU/GPU as developers working on the Switch due to the Proton compatibility layer.\nOne of the main criticisms of the Steam Deck highlighted by multiple reviewers has been its battery life. Matt Hanson writing for \"TechRadar\" stated, \"the battery life of the Steam Deck is pretty poor, with it just about managing one and a half hours while playing \"God of War\"\u00a0... That's going to upset a lot of people who may have been planning on using the Steam Deck for long flights, for example\" and that \"it certainly makes this portable gaming system feel less\u00a0... well, portable.\" Matt Miller of \"Game Informer\" called the device's battery life \"punishingly low\". Steve Hogarty wrote in \"The Independent\" that \"The battery life is by far the Steam deck's biggest weakness. The handheld PC chugs through juice like it's going out of fashion, with some graphically demanding games draining a full charge in as little as two hours of playtime.\" Seth G. Macy wrote for IGN in very similar terms, saying, \"Beyond that limitation, the biggest, most deflating issue I've had has been battery life. It's all over the place and probably the biggest reality check when it comes to realizing the dream of truly untethered PC gaming.\" Richard Leadbetter of \"Eurogamer\" said he \"can't help [but] feel that elements like fan noise and battery life can only be resolved with a revised processor on a more efficient process node.\"\nSales.\nThe research firm Omdia reported that the Steam Deck sold 1.62\u00a0million units in 2022. Their report estimated that the Steam Deck would pass 3 million units sold since its launch sometime during 2023. Through 2022 and most of 2023, the Deck had been one of the most popular purchases on the Steam storefront. Valve stated in November 2023 that they had sold \"multiple millions\" of the Steam Deck. Market research firm International Data Corporation estimated that between 3.7 and 4 million Steam Deck had been sold by the third anniversary of the device in February 2025.\nLegacy.\nThe Steam Deck is credited with triggering a wave of similar handheld gaming computers.

This was the band's first album since \"You're Welcome\" was released four years earlier. The band worked with producer Dave Sitek, and the album's themes were inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBackground.\nIn early 2019, Wavves began recording songs for what would become their seventh studio album. This would become their first new music released since the 2018 standalone singles \"All Star Goth\" and \"Emo Christmas\". After early studio sessions reportedly lacked surprises and \"magic\", according to frontman Nathan Williams, the band began working with producer Dave Sitek. According to Williams, melodies were initially built around short samples of songs from the 1950s and 1960s before removing those samples and creating the rest of the song's structure. The album's lyrical themes were reportedly inspired by Williams living in a shed behind his parents' house during the album's recording, along with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRelease and tour.\nOn March 30, 2021, the album's first single \"Sinking Feeling\" was released.

He is the founder and the spokesperson of the BASE experiment (AD-8) at the Antiproton Decelerator facility at CERN, Geneva. Stefan Ulmer is well known for his contributions to improving Penning trap techniques and precision measurements on antimatter. He is the first person to observe spin transitions with a single trapped proton as well as single spin transitions with a single trapped antiproton, a significant achievement towards a precision measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment.\nStefan Ulmer completed his Ph.D. thesis from the Heidelberg University, Germany, under the supervision Wolfgang Quint and Klaus Blaum in 2011. Ulmer's studies focused on the first observation of spin flips with a single proton stored in a cryogenic Penning trap. In 2012 he was promoted to a PI position at RIKEN, Japan, and in 2019 he became co-director of a MPG, RIKEN, PTB center for time, constants, and fundamental symmetries.\nResearch.\nAfter his Ph.D. studies, Stefan Ulmer joined the ASACUSA CUSP experiment at CERN in 2012 as a postdoctorate fellow, and contributed to the production of the first polarized beam of antihydrogen atoms. Simultaneously, he worked on setting up the BASE experiment. He invented a reservoir trap technique that allowed BASE to store antiprotons for about 400 days.\u00a0 In 2014, Stefan Ulmer\u2019s team performed the most precise measurement of the proton-antiproton charge-to-mass ratio, evidently the most accurate test of CPT invariance of baryons. In 2017, his team reported the first observation of single antiproton spin transitions, and also completed the most precise measurements of antiproton magnetic moment.\u00a0From a time-base analysis of these data the most stringent limits on dark-matter / antimatter coupling were derived. Inspired by this work, the BASE collaboration has used Penning trap detection systems as axion haloscopes, to set competitive limits on axion-to-photon conversion. In 2022 Ulmer's team reported on a comparison of the proton/antiproton charge-to-mass ratio with a fractional accuracy of 16 parts in a trillion. This measurement also constitutes the first differential test of the clock weak equivalence principle with antiprotons. Ulmer's measurements are considered to be outstanding and of great value for fundamental physics research.\nAwards and recognition.\nStefan Ulmer has received the following awards and recognition for his contributions to fundamental experimental physics.", "Di Chaliastre\n\nDi Chaliastre or Khalyastre (, from Polish \"halastra\" - gang) was a Jewish avant-garde expressionist-futuristic group of poets, who worked in Warsaw between 1919 and 1924. The poets wrote in Yiddish and published a namesake magazine.\nThe name of the group comes from the term Hillel Zeitlin used for them in the newspaper . The group was formed around 1922 around M. Weichert's literary and artistic monthly magazine \"Ringen\", published since 1921. Its main contributors were Peretz Markish, Melech Ravitch and Uri Zvi Greenberg.\nPoets , , and David Hofstein also became a part of the group.\nHistory.\nSeth L. Wolitz divided the group's history into three periods:\n(1) the year 1919, with the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a group associated with \"Yung-yidish\"; (2) the transitional period 1921\u20131922, with the group surrounding Mikhal Vaykhert (Micha\u0142 Weichert) and Alter-Sholem Kacyzne's \"Ringen\"; and (3) the golden period of 1922\u20131924, which spawned \"Di Khalyastre\", \"Vog\" (The Scales; edited by Melech Ravitch), and \"Albatros\", the most thoroughly avant-garde expressionist journal of Uri Tsevi Grinberg.\nThe first edition of the almanac with the title \"Khalyastre\" was published in Warsaw in 1922; the editors were Peretz Markish and Israel Joshua Singer.

Ewing intended to connect black men and black boys with shared interests and to unite them under one common goal. That goal was to reduce prejudice that they were facing and end the times of slave owners calling their slaves \"negro\". Its audience came to include a significant number of gay men, who used the magazine to post covert personal advertisements at a time when homosexuality was socially taboo and legally proscribed.\nPublication history.\n\"The Hobby Directory\" was founded in 1946 by Francis Willard Ewing (1896\u20131984), a New Jersey high school teacher.\nIt was the official publication of the National Association of Hobbyists for Men and Boys. \"The Hobby Directory\" was sold openly, including at craft stores. In addition, classified advertisements soliciting subscribers appeared in the national magazines \"Popular Mechanics\" and \"Popular Science\", the latter directed to \"men and boys only.\"\nAccording to the copyright registration filed with the United States Copyright Office, the publication initially appeared twice a year, in June or July and in December. The run held by the GLBT Historical Society suggests the magazine later appeared quarterly and continued publishing until at least March 1952. The March 1952 issue is likewise the final one registered with the Copyright Office.\nHistorian David K. Johnson speculates that the magazine may have ceased publication following a \"police crackdown\" at a time when US authorities were vigorously enforcing the Comstock laws which prohibited sending obscene material through the mail.\nContents.\nThe \"Directory\" described its mission as being \"to help its members find hobby friends\". The typewritten magazine consisted entirely of classified ads. In a typical ad, members would list their age, location, occupation, and hobbies or interests, such as model trains, particular genres of music, or rock collecting. Members would also indicate what sort of correspondence they sought from others using the initialism \"C.D.\" for \"Contacts Desired\".\nGay audience.\nThe magazine was notably used by gay men seeking to connect with other gay men, to the point that writer Daniel Harris describes it as \"little more than a bizarre dating service\".\nAt the time of \"The Hobby Directory\"s publication, the ability of gay men in the US to express their sexuality was extremely limited. Prior to the 1958 Supreme Court case \"One, Inc. v. Olesen\", writing on homosexuality was liable to be classified as obscene, and the transmission of such materials through the postal system was vigorously policed by the US Postal Service, enforcing the Comstock laws. The first enduring gay membership organization, the Mattachine Society, was not founded until 1950. Some gay men formed clandestine communities centered around certain bars, bathhouses, and public meeting places, though they risked police raids, and this option was foreclosed to men living in rural areas.\nUnable to advertise their desires openly, many gay men turned to classified ads in publications such as \"The Hobby Directory\", signaling to other gay men using coded references to interests such as physical culture, sunbathing, ballet, or wrestling. Another potential signal were professions suggestive of \"gender inversion\" such as florist, nurse, or hairdresser. Scholar William Leap suggests that such ads would not have been likely to arouse suspicion in an average reader because they made use of \"familiar words and phrases\" rather than any peculiar secret codes.\nIt is unknown whether Ewing intended to cater to gay men, or the degree to which he was aware of the magazine's large gay audience. Michael Waters notes that Ewing apparently had a genuine zeal for hobbies, given that, more than a decade before the magazine's debut, he had founded a student hobbyist club at the high school at which he taught. As evidence of Ewing's complicity, some scholars have pointed to a notice printed by Ewing in a 1951 issue in which he chastised members for lying about their age, deceiving younger members who wished to correspond only with members of similar ages for purposes such as sharing \"photos of young men in service uniforms\" or \"memorabilia related to boys famous in history\".\nThe proportion of gay-coded advertisements appears to have increased over the span of the magazine's existence. David K. Johnson views later issues of \"The Hobby Directory\" as increasingly coming to resemble the physique magazines which were becoming increasingly popular among gay men. Later issues of the \"Directory\" would include photos of members, and \"cover art featuring naked boys seen from behind\".\nScarcity.\nThe only known surviving issues of \"The Hobby Directory\" are preserved in the holdings of the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco. The collection, consisting of 24 issues ranging from July 1946 to March 1952, came to the institution's archives as part of the papers of Bois Burk (1906\u20131993). A gay man who served as one of Alfred Kinsey's research informants, Burk marked up some of his copies of the magazine with notes regarding his contacts with men who had placed personal advertisements.", "Paul Conlon (footballer)\n\nPaul Robert Conlon (born 5 January 1978) is an English former footballer who played for Hartlepool United, Sunderland, Gateshead and Doncaster Rovers.

The CBI submitted a closure report on 2013, stating they could not establish how the explosives arrived at the location and which people were behind it.\nThe judicial commission report rejected allegations that the police firing is unjustifiable and concluded that it was the police action which prevented a large scale communal riot.

She began writing humorous stories and commentaries based on the rural German-Canadian Lutheran farming community she was raised within in 1950. Story's works were broadcast on CBC Radio and did home-based literary reports for the network. authored multiple novels and published a poetry collection during the early 1980s to the early 1990s. She served as writer-in-residence of across various Canadian institutions and was an active member of the Saskatchewan Writers' Guild. The works of Story have been studied in Australian and German university classes.\nEarly life and education.\nOn September 19, 1929, Story was born in the Bergheim district, close to Sutherland, Saskatchewan, in Canada. She was the daughter of Rheinhold and Mathilda (Jabusch) Wudrick, and was raised in a German-Canadian Lutheran farming community, with three siblings. She left the Lutheran farming community at a young age and did not return. In 1976, Story matriculated to the University of Saskatchewan, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree with distinction in 1981. She earned the university's Arts Prize and President's Medal honours as the College of Arts and Science's most distinguished graduate.\nCareer.\nFollowing the completion of her high school education, she began her career as a bank clerk. In 1950, having received encouragement from her husband to express herself in writing, she began to author funny stories and commentaries based on rural life she grew up in. Story's works were broadcast on CBC Radio, and she made literary reports from her Vanscoy, Saskatchewan home for the network. In 1978, she earned the Saskatchewan Culture &amp; Youth Poetry Prize, giving her the W. O. Mitchell bursary, and a CBC Radio Literary Award two years later. She was named third prize winner in the short story category for \"But First You Ought to Ask The Bride\" at the 1981 CBC Literary Competition. Story's first book, which was a poem collection, \"The Book of Thirteen\" was published by Thistledown Press in 1981. The following year, she received the Saskatchewan Writers\u2019 Guild Children's Literature Award.\nStory's first novel, \"The Way to Always Dance\", was published in 1983, followed by her second novel, \"It Never Pays to Laugh Too Much\", a year later and her third novel, \"The Need of Wanting Always\", in 1985. During 1986, she authored \"Black Swan\" and \"Rowena, Rowena, Rowena\". Story published her autobiography, \"The Last House on Main Street\", in 1988. Her final works, \"After Sixty: Going Home\", and, \"How to Saw Wood with an Angel\", were published in 1991 and 1992 respectively. From 1984 to 1985, Story was made writer-in-residence of Prince Albert by the Saskatchewan Writers' Guild as part of Saskatchewan's government resident artist program, the Saskatoon Public Library between September 1986 and July 1987, the University of Winnipeg in 1988, the Moose Jaw Public Library until July 1991, and was appointed the same role of the Yukon Territory in the North of Canada, serving from September 1991 to February 1992.\nShe was an active member of the Saskatchewan Writers' Guild.

She died in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, on January 18, 2014. Story was given a direct cremation without a funeral service as per a request.\nWriting style and legacy.\nVerne Clemence of \"The StarPhoenix\" called Story's writing style as \"Words such as 'growingess' characterize Story's writing style.\" Clemence further noted \"The changes in the people in her new stories from those in her past books are subtle. But the distinctions are significant. Most in the new crop are serene. They've left behind the angst-ridden, 30-something years, where the preoccupations were making a living, fleeting romances and the stresses of the competitive, materialistic world.\"\nThe works of Story have been studied in Australian and German university classes. The University of Saskatchewan Archives and Special Collections held an exhibition displaying a collection of her works and information about the writer at the Murray Library from January to February 2014.", "Shields formula\n\nThe Shields formula is a formula for the stability calculation of granular material (sand, gravel) in running water.\nThe stability of granular material in flow can be determined by the Shields formula or the Izbash formula. The first is more suitable for fine grain material (such as sand and gravel), while the Izbash formula is more suitable for larger stone. The Shields formula was developed by Albert F. Shields (1908-1974). In fact, the Shields method determines whether or not the soil material will move. The Shields parameter thus determines whether or not there is a beginning of movement.\nDerivation.\nMovement of (loose grained) soil material occurs when the shear pressure exerted by the water on the soil is greater than the resistance the soil provides. This dimensionless ratio (the Shields parameter) was first described by Albert Shields and reads: \nwhere:\nThe shear stress that works on the bottom (with a normal uniform flow along a slope) is:\nwhere:\nIt is important to realise that formula_8 is the shear stress exerted by the flow (i.e. a property of the flow) and formula_2 is the shear stress at which the grains move (i.e. a property of the grains).\nThe shear stress velocity is often used instead of the shear stress: \nThe shear stress velocity has the dimension of a velocity (m/s), but is actually a representation of the shear stress. So the shear stress velocity can never be measured with a velocity meter.\nBy using the shear stress velocity, the Shields parameter can also be written as: \nwhere: \nShields found that the parameter formula_17 is a function of formula_18, in which formula_19 is the kinematic viscosity. This parameter is also called the granular reynolds number: \nShields has performed tests with grains of different densities, and the found value of formula_17 plotted as a function of formula_22. This led to the above graph. \nVan Rijn found that instead of the granular reynolds number a dimensionless grain size could be used:\nBecause usually the values of formula_24 are quite constant, the true grain size can also be set on the horizontal axis (see right figure b). This means that the value of formula_17 is only a function of the grain diameter and can be read directly.\nFrom this follows that for grains greater than 5\u00a0mm the Shields parameter gets a constant value of 0,055.\nThe gradient of a river (\"I\") can be determined by Ch\u00e9zy formula: \nin which formula_27 = the coeffici\u00ebnt of Ch\u00e9zy (); This is often in the order 50 (). For a flat bed (i.e. without ripples) C can be approximated with: \nBy introducing this into the stability formula, a critical grain size formula is found at a given flow rate: \nIn this form, the stability relationship is usually called the \"Shields formula\".\nDefinition of \"incipient motion\".\nThe line of Shields (and of Van Rijn) in the graph is the separation between \"movement\" and \"no movement\". Shields has defined as \"movement\" that almost all grains move on the bottom. This is a useful definition for defining the beginning of sand transport by flow. However, if one wants to protect a bed from erosion, the requirement is that grains should hardly move. To make this operational, Breusers defined 7 phases of movement in 1969:\nThese phases are shown in the figure below:\nIn practice, this means that for bed protections (where the grain is always larger than 5mm), a design value of \u03a8=0.03 must be used.\nCalculation Example.\nQuestion: At what speed of flow does sand of 0.2cm move at a water depth of 1m? \nQuestion: What stone size is needed to defend this soil against a current of 2\u00a0m/s? \nRestrictions.\nThe Shields approach is based on a uniform, permanent flow with a turbulence generated by the bed roughness (i.e. no additional turbulence by a for example a propeller current). In the case of a rough bed in shallow water, and in case of unusual turbulence, the Izbash's formula is therefore more recommended.", "Jason Oates\n\nJason Mark Oates (born 11 July 1974) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer.

All 13 members of the Territory Council were elected. Councilors served one-year terms.\nThe Iowa Territory existed from July 4, 1838, until December 28, 1846, when Iowa was admitted to the Union as a state. At the time, the Iowa Territory had a Legislative Assembly consisting of an upper chamber (i.e., the Territory Council) and a lower chamber (i.e., the Territory House of Representatives).\nFollowing the previous election in 1843, Democrats held a majority with seven seats to Whigs' six seats. During the sixth session of the Territory Council, Councilor Cox died, causing a vacancy in a Democratic Party seat. Therefore, on election day in 1844, the Democrats and Whigs both had six seats each.\nTo claim a majority of seats, the Whigs needed to net one seat from Democrats.\nDemocrats maintained a majority of seats in the Iowa Territory Council following the 1844 general election with the balance of power shifting to Democrats holding 11 seats and Whigs having two seats (a net gain of 5 seat for Democrats, including regaining the vacant seat). Democratic Councilor Serranus Clinton Hastings was chosen as the President of the seventh Territory Council to succeed the deceased Democratic Councilor Thomas Cox in that leadership position.\nSummary of Results.\nSource:\nExternal links.\nDistrict boundaries for the Iowa Territory Council were redrawn before the 1844 general election:", "The Family Dog Denver\n\n&lt;mapframe latitude=\"39.678672\" longitude=\"-105.006566\" zoom=\"11\" width=\"264\" height=\"302\" align=\"right\"&gt;\n \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n \"features\": [\n \"type\": \"Feature\",\n \"properties\": {},\n \"geometry\": {\n \"type\": \"Point\",\n \"coordinates\": [\n -105.00531805213542,\n 39.679366045496295\n ]\n&lt;/mapframe&gt;\nThe Family Dog Denver (also known as The Family Dog or simply The Dog) was a concert dance hall located at 1601 West Evans Avenue in Denver, Colorado. Opened from September 1967 to July 1968, it is regarded as a seminal music venue that launched Denver on its trajectory to its current status as a major concert destination by introducing never-before-seen acts like The Doors, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Buffalo Springfield, Janis Joplin, Chuck Berry, as well as the Grateful Dead's first performances in the state of Colorado in 1967. Many acts, like The Doors and Van Morrison, for example, had yet to become famous when they played The Dog, evidenced by the poster artists having to stylize the names of their leading songs into the poster art for the shows. The Family Dog is also seen as a cultural turning point in Denver from the conservative, western-minded sensibility of the early and mid-20th century to the current, liberal-minded climate. The venue's history, surrounding drama and ultimate impact had been largely unknown and unrealized until it was unearthed and detailed for the first time in the 2021 documentary \"The Tale of the Dog\", produced and directed by Dan Obarski &amp; Scott Montgomery and distributed by Cinedigm. As there are no useful photos, no video and little written history remaining of the Family Dog Denver, the film's oral history format told in first person by the people who were there serves as a definitive reference for \u201cThe Dog.\u201d\nHistory.\nPre-1967.\nDenver, prior to the opening of the Family Dog, was not a major music destination. There had been a modest jazz scene in the Five Points neighborhood which hosted international acts such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. Beginning in the early 1960s there had also been a folk music scene, led by Harry Tuft at the Denver Folklore Center, who brought in the likes of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Judy Collins. Otherwise, most music venues, like the Exodus, Catacombs and The Cave, featured local bands with limited, if any, national exposure.\n1967: Barry Fey Meets Chet Helms.\nIn early 1967, Barry and Cynthia Fey, who had been booking concert acts like The Association, Alice Cooper and Eric Burdon at the University of Denver, flew with his wife to San Francisco to meet with Chet Helms, co-owner (with Bob Cohen) of Family Dog Productions. At that time Helms was a primary figure in the San Francisco hippie scene, with his Family Dog Productions running the legendary Avalon Ballroom, where he cultivated acts like the Grateful Dead, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company.\nThe Feys brought with him a demo tape of a Denver psychedelic rock band named The Eighth Penny Matter as evidence that the music was popular in Denver and that importing the Haight-Ashbury music scene to Denver could be a successful business venture. They subsequently convinced Helms and Cohen to co-open up a music venue similar to the Avalon Ballroom, in Denver.\nSummer 1967: The Human Be-In and the Love-In.\nThe hippie scene had already been germinating in Denver by mid 1967. That summer on Sunday July 30 1967, a Love- In was held in Washington Park. The Love-In was organized by \"Great American Tea and Cement Company of Denver,\" described as \u201ca colony of working hippie artists.\u201d Some of the local Denver bands that played at the Wash Park Love-In included Beggar's Opera Company, Hannigan's Greenhouse, and the Crystal Palace Guard. Odetta closed as the last performer at the Love-In that evening.\nIn order to jumpstart the Family Dog Denver, Barry Fey, and the leaders of the Dog, including Tony Guillory, James \u201cButch\u201d Grayer, Marc Arno Richardson, and others, put on a Human Be-In Denver's City Park that summer, modeled on the famed event that took place in San Francisco in January of that year. The goal of the Be-In, in addition to generating interest in the Family Dog Denver, was to organize an event around the common sentiments of that time, including peace, love and brotherhood. Bands that played the Be-In included the Grateful Dead, Odetta, and Captain Beefheart. 5,000 people were reported to have attended.\nPsychedelic Poster Art.\nWith the impending opening of the Family Dog Denver, the arrangement was made for each of the concert posters to be done by the legendary San Francisco psychedelic poster artists, including Rick Griffin, Stanley Mouse, Alton Kelley, Victor Moscoso, Bob Schnepf, Bob Fried, and Dennis Nolan.\nSeptember 8 &amp; 9, 1967: The Family Dog Denver Opens.\nThe first concert at the Dog was Janis Joplin &amp; Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company, Blue Cheer &amp; The Eighth Penny Matter. The poster for the show was designed by Rick Griffin.\nPsychedelic Lightshow.\nAs a result of bringing the San Francisco scene directly to Denver, Denver for a brief time had one of the first and potentially biggest, liquid light shows on earth, run by Diogenes Lantern Works and owner Marc Arno Richardson. The liquid light show was a groundbreaking experience where light was projected through textured glass that was filled with colored liquids and onto the walls of the Family Dog while the bands were playing. This was the precursor to the modern concert light show.\nLothar &amp; The Hand People.\nA group of musicians from Denver formed the band Lothar and the Hand People in 1965. Using a theremin as their primary instrument, and subsequently being sponsored by Robert Moog, inventor of the synthesizer, Lothar and the Hand People took top billing over The Doors and Captain Beefheart when they played the Family Dog Denver for the first time in 1967. They went on to become enormously influential as one of the pioneers of electronic music and had an outsized impact on the development of rock &amp; roll, with its members opening Electric Lady Land Studios with Jimi Hendrix, and helping to produce some of the most famous rock albums ever made.\nFall 1967: Police Take Notice.\nAs the popularity of the venue exploded that fall, and the so-called hippie phenomenon and drug use that accompanied it became more prevalent around the city, parents and city leaders became concerned and exerted pressure on the police to shut down the Family Dog and eradicate the city of the hippies. Detective John Gray became the face of the police leading the efforts to get a hold of the situation at the Family Dog. This involvement lead to numerous municipal court cases as well as a federal court case.\nCanned Heat Bust.\nOne of the most controversial and dramatic episodes of the Family Dog's tenure was the bust of Canned Heat for marijuana possession, at the Ranch Motor Inn, located at Santa Fe and Florida Ave, prior to their scheduled show at the Family Dog on October 21, 1967. During this episode, Canned Heat claimed the Denver police planted the drugs on them. The Denver police deny this was the case. In order to pay their bail, Canned Heat signed over their publishing rights to Al Bennet of Liberty Records. Regardless of who was telling the truth, the result was that Canned Heat has never made a dime off of their major hits, including the Woodstock anthem, Going Up the Country.\nDecember 1967: Chet Helms Pulls Out &amp; Barry Fey Takes Over.\nDue to a combination of pressure from the city and miss-management of funds by the venue, by December 1967, after four months in operation, Family Dog Productions left Denver. After a brief closure, the Feys reopened the Dog and ran it themselves, bringing in acts like Cream, The Byrds Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin.\nJuly 1968: The Dog Closes for Good.\nAs Barry Fey's vision grew, The Dog closed and he moved on to become one of the world's biggest and most influential rock promoters. The Feys started Feyline Productions, and helped pioneer and define the era of Rock promotion. Feyline held the 1969 Denver Pop Festival, Cynthia opened up the Denver concert venue Ebbets Field with Chuck Morris. Feyline re-developed Red Rocks Amphitheater into a major concert venue, and opened the Rainbow Music Hall. Along the way Feyline was pivotal in the early promotion of countless bands like Led Zeppelin, Queen and Black Sabbath. Of particular note was Barry's promotion of the 1983 , which has been credited for catapulting U2 to global fame as well as making Red Rocks Amphitheater an internationally recognized music venue.

Specifically, it was Barry and Cynthia Fey's vision of bringing an Avalon Ballroom- type of venue to Denver and successful efforts to convince Chet Helms to open up the Family Dog in Denver that put Denver on the so-called music map permanently.", "Ichneutica chryserythra\n\nIchneutica chryserythra is a moth of the family Noctuidae. Living specimens have distinctive violet red coloured forewings but can be distinguished from the similar species \"Ichneutica marmorata\" as it lacks the dark edge markings of the later species. \"I. chryserythra\" can only be found in the southern parts of the South Island. Adults are on the wing between November and January. The life history of the species and the host species of its larvae are unknown.\nTaxonomy.\nThis species was first described by George Hampson from both a male and a female specimen and named \"Morrisonia chryserythra\". The male type specimen was collected in Orepuki by Mr Dunlop and is now held at the Natural History Museum, London. The female specimen is said to be in the Dunlop Collection.\nIn his 1988 catalogue, J. S. Dugale stated that this species was within the \"Graphania\" genus. In 2019 Robert Hoare undertook a major review of New Zealand Noctuidae species. During this review the genus \"Ichneutica\" was greatly expanded and the genus \"Graphania\" was subsumed into that genus as a synonym. As a result of this review, this species is now known as \"Ichneutica hartii.\"\nDescription.\nHampson described the species as follows:\nThis moth is distinctive, with a violet red hue to the forewings in living specimens. The male has a wingspan of between 40 and 43\u00a0mm and the female of between 48 and 49\u00a0mm. This species has darker forms and may be confused with \"I. marmorata\" however the later species has forewings that are edged with dark markings. The appearance of this moth tends to fade to tawny as specimens age.\nDistribution.\nIt is endemic to New Zealand and can only be found in the southern parts of the South Island.\nHabitat.\nThis species can be found in copper tussock grassland as well as in podocarp forests. It has been collected in open habitats as well as dense forest in the Catlins, often at higher altitudes but can occur at lower altitudes, including down to sea level at its type locality. It appears to be absent from dryer localities.\nBehaviour.\nAdults of this species are on the wing from November to January.\nLife history and host species.\nThe life history of this species is unknown as are the host species of its larvae. It is possible that the larvae of this species is a monocot feeder and it has been hypothesised that the larvae consume \"Chionochloa rubra cuprea.\" However, as the species is also found in podocarp forest the host species of the larvae may include other plant species.", "Elisabeth Wild\n\nElisabeth Wild (6 February 1922 \u2013 12 February 2020) was an Austrian collage artist.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Europe, Wild emigrated to Argentina with her parents in Franz and Stefanie Pollack in 1938.

Despite his contributions to his unit, Rienau is among the only aces of Jasta 19 not to be awarded the Pour le M\u00e9rite, Iron Cross, or the Hohenzollern Order. On 13 September 1918, he was shot down and successfully bailed out of his Fokker D.VII from just 500 meters. He became a flight instructor after the war, but died in a flying accident in 1925.\nEarly life and service.\nRudolf Rienau was born on the island of Sylt off the coast of Germany and Denmark. He served in the infantry from mid-1915 until spring 1917, when in April he volunteered for pilot training under the Luftstreitkrafte.\nAerial service.\nRienau joined Jasta 1 in October 1917, but was quickly moved to Jasta 19 by the end of the month. It was in this Jasta in which he gained his first aerial victory in March 1918 and his second in June. At this time Rienau flew a Fokker Dr.I triplane serial 504/17, identified by white diagonal stripes along the fuselage in the fashion of other German fighter pilots with similarly customized paint schemes.\nOn 13 September 1918, while flying north of Charey, Rienau's Fokker D.VII was hit by fire from an American SPAD of the 13th Aero Squadron and went into a dive. After attempting to right the aircraft, he bailed out 500 meters above the ground, his Fokker crashing 150 meters from where he landed in his parachute. Some historians deem his survival lucky, considering nearly a third of German pilots who bailed from their aircraft died in the attempt, including fellow Jasta 19 ace and commanding officer Leutnant Hans Pippart whose parachute didn't open in time when his Fokker went down on 11 August 1918.\nHe returned to combat the day after the crash, scoring his 3rd victory against a Breguet reconnaissance aircraft. He then scored 2 more victories in the following days, downing a SPAD on the 15th and a Breguet on the 16th. His final victory was over another SPAD on the 29th, ending September with six kills and the title of flying ace. This tally made Rienau the third highest contributor to Jasta 19's 93 victories, tied with Walter B\u00f6ning. Despite his high tally, he was one of the only aces of Jasta 19 to not be awarded the Iron Cross, an honor given to aces of equivalent scores like Leutnant Arthur Rahn and Oberleutnant Erich Hahn.\nPostwar years.\nAfter the war, Rienau became a flying instructor and taught throughout the early 1920s.

She is the founder of the Central Area Chamber of Commerce, a group that focused on the common challenges facing Black business owners in the late twentieth century. She ran for Mayor of Seattle in 1993 and a Seattle City Council seat in 1997.\nPersonal life.\nWilliams was born in Temple, Texas and her family moved to Portland, Oregon in 1945 where she was raised. She graduated from high school and got married at age 15 to Robert \"Bobby\" Williams, and the couple moved to Seattle. The couple divorced in 1965 when Williams was 22 years old.\nWilliams was a member of the South Side Church of Christ in Skyway, Washington. She was an enthusiastic church participant and was known to miss community events that conflicted with Bible Study. She was a mother of two and grandmother to eight by the time of her death in 2018. Williams passed away due to cancer at age 75.\nEducation.\nUpon moving to Seattle, Williams attended Seattle Central College (which was called Seattle Edison at the time of her attendance), and earned an AA degree. Following this, she attended Edwards Beauty School and graduated in 1961.\nCareer.\nWilliams wrote two short books on the history of the Central District; one was published in 1990 and the second in 1996. Her connection to the mayoral administration of the time helped her secure a grant for the books. Copies of the book are available at the Seattle Public Library\nBeauty Salon Business.\nWilliams opened her first beauty salon at age 22 shortly after her divorce on the corner of 25th Ave and Union St in the heart of Seattle's historically Black Central District in 1965. The shop contained just three salon chairs. When it opened she continued to work two additional jobs at the Seattle Tennis Center and Fircrest Hospital while raising her two children in order to save money to buy a permanent building for her salon. In her search to buy a building, Williams was denied a business loan by 30 different banks. In the 1960s, it was difficult and rare for a single woman to be able to purchase property and especially so for women of color. Reportedly, Williams eventually obtained a loan by convincing a banker to use only her first initial to obscure her gender from the loan application.\nThen in 1968, Williams purchased a one-story brick building on E Madison St in the Central District for $35,000 and employed up to 13 women. Her business was often vandalized in the early years. In the 1970s, Williams also opened a boutique in Bellevue, Washington's vibrant business district and hers was the only Black-owned business on the strip. The clothing sold in the boutique was colorful and vibrant, often decorated with sequins. Her clothing was often worn by the women of the community to their Sunday church services. The boutique eventually closed so Williams could focus more time on her activism and political interests. Williams earned several accolades from local governments and civic groups for her work in advancing Black progress in civil rights and community and economic development that were proudly displayed in her salon. She differentiated her business by earning a reputation for vibrant non-natural hair colors done to a high quality. The E Madison storefront persists after her death, with Williams continuing to work on clients' hair until shortly before her passing.\nIn 1983 Williams founded the Central Area Chamber of Commerce to focus on assisting local Black business owners with challenges such as being denied loans that could help them save or grow their businesses. The organization was run out of the same brick building that is home to Williams' salon business. Through the chamber, Williams pursued a passion of educating her community and encouraging they become involved in city planning and development. In this capacity, Williams published a Black business directory, a calendar of community events, assisted in the founding of a local newspaper, and stepped further into the political activism sphere.\nIn the early twenty-first century, the Central District began gentrifying and many Black owned businesses began to disappear from the neighborhood, often times being replaced by apartment buildings. Williams attributed the departure of Black businesses to rising rents, and believed that property ownership was a major contributor to her long-lasting success. Real estate developers sought to buy Williams' E Madison property from her, but she remained adamant the business and property remain in the family. Williams was disheartened and angered to learn in 2018 that developers had purchased the plot of land available adjacent to her business on the corner of 21st and Madison, and that a multi-story complex would be built to overshadow her humble building. At the time of her death, Seattle residents who had grown up in the Central District saw DeCharlene's Salon as a last bastion that remained of the mid-century golden age of Black owned small businesses.\nBefore her death, Williams reportedly had hopes to open a beauty school. Media artifacts of Williams' contributions to Seattle have been preserved by the Museum of History &amp; Industry which has also hosted events in her honor.\nPosthumous legacy of the salon.\nFollowing her death the salon is owned an operated by Williams' daughter Rita Green and her niece and granddaughter are head stylists.

It rises in the mountains at the southern end of the Poisoned Glen (Irish: \"Cr\u00f3 Nimhe\"), these mountains being part of the Derryveagh Mountains. It then flows in a north-westerly direction for its entire course. The burn flows through the Poisoned Glen, flowing along the middle of the glen's floor. It flows along the southern edge of Dunlewey (Irish: \"D\u00fan L\u00faiche\"), a village at the foot of Errigal (Irish: \"An Earagail\"). The burn then flows into the Devlin River (Irish: \"Abhainn Dhuibhlinne\"), joining that river very near its mouth, on the southern edge of Dunlewey. The Devlin River then flows on for a few hundred yards, flowing into Dunlewey Lough (Irish: \"Loch Dh\u00fan L\u00faiche\"), the river emptying into the south-eastern end of the lough.\nNear the mouth of the Cronaniv Burn, beside where the burn meets the Devlin River, sits the ruins of Dunlewey Church of Ireland Church.

Her father, Lutfi al-Haffar, briefly served as prime minister of Syria in 1939. He was supportive of her professional pursuits, and after initially attending a Muslim religious school, she studied Arabic, English, and French at a private Franciscan school, at a time when girls' education was unusual in Syria. She then studied political science by correspondence with a Jesuit university in Beirut, but she did not complete a degree.\nCareer.\nWriting.\nIn 1940, Kuzbari published her first work in \"Al Ahad\", a magazine based in Damascus. A decade later, she published her first book, the autobiographical \"Hala's Diaries\", in 1950. She produced a series of short story collections in the 1950s and '60s, as well as two French-language poetry collections, \"Solitary Rose\" in 1958 and \"Yesterday's Scent\" in 1966.\nFrom her early literary career, Kuzbari's writing addressed the inner lives of women, a rare subject for Syrian literature at the time.\nShe spent many years living abroad, notably in Spain, where she worked at the Syrian Embassy. There, she became keenly interested in the Spanish Golden Age in Andalusia. This experience informed both her best-received novel, \"The Two Eyes of Seville\" (1965), and her 2000 memoir \"Spanish and Andalusian Memories with Nizar Kabbani and his Letters\", which was inspired by her friendship with the poet Nizar Qabbani. Her contributions to Syrian scholarship on Andalusia are considered significant, and for her work on the subject she was awarded a medal from the Spanish government in 1964 and the University of Palermo's Mediterranean Literature Award in 1980.\nIn 1970, she published a second autobiographical book, \"Amber and Ashes.\" This was followed in 1974 by the novel \"Bitter Oranges\", which deals with young Palestinian women's lives in the throes of conflict.

She dedicated 17 years of her career to researching Ziadeh and wrote several books on her life, including \"May Ziadeh and the Tragedy of Genius\" (1961) and \"Blue Flame: The Love Letters of Kahlil Gibran to May Ziadeh\" (1979), the latter of which was widely translated. In 1995, she was awarded the King Faisal Prize for Arabic Language and Literature for her work.\nIn 1994, Kuzbari published her first and only Spanish-language poetry collection, \"The Eve of the Voyage\".

At an early age she rejected the traditional black hijab, preferring instead a white headscarf. She was involved in various women's organizations and attended international human rights conferences.\nThis activity extended to charitable work, with Kuzbari co-founding in 1945 the children's charity Mabarat al Taleem wa al-Muwasaat (the Mabarra Association for Education and Consolation), which cared for young orphans.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1941, she married Mohammed Karami, the brother of the Lebanese independence leader Abdul Hamid Karami, but he was killed just a month after their first child, a son, was born.\nShe remarried in 1948, wedding the Syrian diplomat Nader al-Kuzbar.

For instance, Minkowski's question-mark function produces an isomorphism (a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence) between the numerical ordering of the rational numbers and the numerical ordering of the dyadic rationals.\nThe theorem is named after Georg Cantor, who first published it in 1895, using it to characterize the (uncountable) ordering on the real numbers. It can be proved by a back-and-forth method that is also sometimes attributed to Cantor but was actually published later, by Felix Hausdorff. The same back-and-forth method also proves that countable dense unbounded orders are highly symmetric, and can be applied to other kinds of structures. However, Cantor's original proof only used the \"going forth\" half of this method. In terms of model theory, the isomorphism theorem can be expressed by saying that the first-order theory of unbounded dense linear orders is countably categorical, meaning that it has only one countable model, up to logical equivalence.\nOne application of Cantor's isomorphism theorem involves temporal logic, a method for using logic to reason about time. In this application, the theorem implies that it is sufficient to use intervals of rational numbers to model intervals of time: using irrational numbers for this purpose will not lead to any increase in logical power.\nStatement and examples.\nCantor's isomorphism theorem is stated using the following concepts:\nWith these definitions in hand, Cantor's isomorphism theorem states that every two unbounded countable dense linear orders are \nWithin the rational numbers, certain subsets are also countable, unbounded, and dense. The rational numbers in the open unit interval are an example. Another example is the set of dyadic rational numbers, the numbers that can be expressed as a fraction with an integer numerator and a power of two as the denominator. By Cantor's isomorphism theorem, the dyadic rational numbers are order-isomorphic to the whole set of rational numbers. In this example, an explicit order isomorphism is provided by Minkowski's question-mark function. Another example of a countable unbounded dense linear order is given by the set of real algebraic numbers, the real roots of polynomials with integer coefficients. In this case, they are a superset of the rational numbers, but are again It is also possible to apply the theorem to other linear orders whose elements are not defined as numbers. For instance, the binary strings that end in a 1, in their lexicographic order, form another isomorphic \nProofs.\nOne proof of Cantor's isomorphism theorem, in some sources called \"the standard uses the back-and-forth method. This proof builds up an isomorphism between any two given orders, using a greedy algorithm, in an ordering given by a countable enumeration of the two orderings. In more detail, the proof maintains two order-isomorphic finite subsets formula_1 and formula_2 of the two given orders, initially empty. It repeatedly increases the sizes of formula_1 and formula_2 by adding a new element from one order, the first missing element in its enumeration, and matching it with an order-equivalent element of the other order, proven to exist using the density and lack of endpoints of the order. The two orderings switch roles at each step: the proof finds the first missing element of the first order, adds it to formula_1, matches it with an element of the second order, and adds it to formula_2; then it finds the first missing element of the second order, adds it to formula_2, matches it with an element of the first order, and adds it to formula_1, etc. Every element of each ordering is eventually matched with an order-equivalent element of the other ordering, so the two orderings are \nAlthough the back-and-forth method has also been attributed to Cantor, Cantor's original publication of this theorem in 1895\u20131897 used a different In an investigation of the history of this theorem by logician Charles L. Silver, the earliest instance of the back-and-forth proof found by Silver was in a 1914 textbook by \nInstead of building up order-isomorphic subsets formula_1 and formula_2 by going \"back and forth\" between the enumeration for the first order and the enumeration for the second order, Cantor's original proof only uses the \"going forth\" half of the back-and-forth It repeatedly augments the two finite sets formula_1 and formula_2 by adding to formula_1 the first missing element of the first order's enumeration, and adding to formula_2 the order-equivalent element that is first in the second order's enumeration. This naturally finds an equivalence between the first ordering and a subset of the second ordering, and Cantor then argues that the entire second ordering is \nThe back-and-forth proof has been formalized as a computer-verified proof using Coq, an interactive theorem prover. This formalization process led to a strengthened result that when two computably enumerable linear orders have a computable comparison predicate, and computable functions representing their density and unboundedness properties, then the isomorphism between them is also \nModel theory.\nOne way of describing Cantor's isomorphism theorem uses the language of model theory. The first-order theory of unbounded dense linear orders consists of sentences in mathematical logic concerning variables that represent the elements of an order, with a binary relation used as the comparison operation of the ordering. Here, a sentence means a well-formed formula that has no free variables. These sentences include both axioms, formulating in logical terms the requirements of a dense linear order, and all other sentences that can be proven as logical consequences from those axioms. The axioms of this system can be expressed \nA model of this theory is any system of elements and a comparison relation that obeys all of the axioms; it is a \"countable model\" when the system of elements forms a countable set. For instance, the usual comparison relation on the rational numbers is a countable model of this theory. Cantor's isomorphism theorem can be expressed by saying that the first-order theory of unbounded dense linear orders is countably categorical: it has only one countable model, up to logical However, it is not categorical for higher cardinalities: for any higher cardinality, there are multiple inequivalent dense unbounded linear orders with the same \nA method of quantifier elimination in the first-order theory of unbounded dense linear orders can be used to prove that it is a complete theory. This means that every logical sentence in the language of this theory is either a theorem, that is, provable as a logical consequence of the axioms, or the negation of a theorem. This is closely related to being categorical (a sentence is a theorem if it is true of the unique countable model; see the \u0141o\u015b\u2013Vaught test) but there can exist multiple distinct models that have the same complete theory. In particular, both the ordering on the rational numbers and the ordering on the real numbers are models of the same theory, even though they are different models. Quantifier elimination can also be used in an algorithm for deciding whether a given sentence is a \nRelated results.\nThe same back-and-forth method used to prove Cantor's isomorphism theorem also proves that countable dense linear orders are highly symmetric. Their symmetries are called order automorphisms, and consist of order-preserving bijections from the whole linear order to itself. By the back-and-forth method, every countable dense linear order has order automorphisms that map any set of formula_15 points to any other set of formula_15 points. This can also be proven directly for the ordering on the rationals, by constructing a piecewise linear order automorphism with breakpoints at the formula_15 given points. This equivalence of all sets of points is summarized by saying that the group of symmetries of a countable dense linear order is \"highly homogeneous\". However, there is no order automorphism that maps an ordered pair of points to its reverse, so these symmetries do not form a \nThe isomorphism theorem can be extended to colorings of an unbounded dense countable linear ordering, with a finite or countable set of colors, such that each color is dense, in the sense that a point of that color exists between any other two points of the whole ordering. The subsets of points with each color partition the order into a family of unbounded dense countable linear orderings. Any partition of an unbounded dense countable linear orderings into subsets, with the property that each subset is unbounded (within the whole set, not just in itself) and dense (again, within the whole set) comes from a coloring in this way. Each two colorings with the same number of colors are order-isomorphic, under any permutation of their colors. give as an example the partition of the rational numbers into the dyadic rationals and their complement; these two sets are dense in each other, and their union has an order isomorphism to any other pair of unbounded linear orders that are countable and dense in each other. Unlike Cantor's isomorphism theorem, the proof needs the full back-and-forth argument, and not just the \"going forth\" \nCantor used the isomorphism theorem to characterize the ordering of the real numbers, an uncountable set. Unlike the rational numbers, the real numbers are Dedekind-complete, meaning that every subset of the reals that has a finite upper bound has a real least upper bound. They contain the rational numbers, which are dense in the real numbers. By applying the isomorphism theorem, Cantor proved that whenever a linear ordering has the same properties of being Dedekind-complete and containing a countable dense unbounded subset, it must be order-isomorphic to the real Suslin's problem asks whether orders having certain other properties of the order on the real numbers, including unboundedness, density, and completeness, must be order-isomorphic to the reals; the truth of this statement is independent of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice \nAlthough uncountable unbounded dense orderings may not be order-isomorphic, it follows from the back-and-forth method that any two such orderings are elementarily equivalent. Another consequence of Cantor's proof is that every finite or countable linear order can be embedded into the rationals, or into any unbounded dense ordering. Calling this a \"well known\" result of Cantor, Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski proved an analogous result for higher cardinality: assuming the continuum hypothesis, there exists a linear ordering of cardinality formula_18 into which all other linear orderings of cardinality formula_18 can be Baumgartner's axiom, formulated by James Earl Baumgartner in 1973 to study the continuum hypothesis, concerns sets of real numbers, unbounded sets with the property that every two elements are separated by exactly formula_18 other elements. It states that each two such sets are order-isomorphic, providing in this way another higher-cardinality analogue of Cantor's isomorphism theorem (formula_18 is defined as the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinals). Baumgartner's axiom is consistent with ZFC and the negation of the continuum hypothesis, and implied by the but independent of \nIn temporal logic, various formalizations of the concept of an interval of time can be shown to be equivalent to defining an interval by a pair of distinct elements of a dense unbounded linear order. This connection implies that these theories are also countably categorical, and can be uniquely modeled by intervals of rational \nSierpi\u0144ski's theorem stating that any two countable metric spaces without isolated points are homeomorphic can be seen as a topological analogue of Cantor's isomorphism theorem, and can be proved using a similar back-and-forth argument.", "Eyo Ukpe\n\nEyo Ukpe is an Oron Village in Udung Uko local government area of Akwa Ibom state in Nigeria.", "Eyo Okponung\n\nEyo Okponung is an Oron Village in Udung Uko local government area of Akwa Ibom state in Nigeria.", "Eyo Nsek\n\nEyo Nsek is an Oron Village in Udung Uko local government area of Akwa Ibom state in Nigeria.", "Eyo Esio Osung\n\nEyo Esio Osung is an Oron Village in Udung Uko local government area of Akwa Ibom state in Nigeria.", "Eyo Ebieme\n\nEbieme is an Oron Village in Udung Uko local government area of Akwa Ibom state in Nigeria.", "SFE Freiburg\n\nSportfreunde Eintracht Freiburg (short: SFE Freiburg) are a sports club from Freiburg im Breisgau.

All 13 members of the Territory Council were elected. Councilors served until the organization of the Iowa General Assembly in 1846 as the legislative branch of the new state of Iowa.\nThe Iowa Territory existed from July 4, 1838, until December 28, 1846, when Iowa was admitted to the Union as a state. At the time, the Iowa Territory had a Legislative Assembly consisting of an upper chamber (i.e., the Territory Council) and a lower chamber (i.e., the Territory House of Representatives). Since statehood in 1846, the General Assembly has served as the legislative branch of Iowa. The Territory Council was the predecessor to the Iowa State Senate, the upper chamber of the Iowa state legislature.\nFollowing the previous election in 1844, Democrats held a majority with 11 seats to Whigs' two seats.\nTo claim a majority of seats, the Whigs needed to net five seats from Democrats.\nThe Democrats maintained a majority of seats in the Council following the 1845 general election with the balance of power remaining unchanged with Democrats holding 11 seats and Whigs having two seats. Democratic Councilor Stephen P. Hempstead was chosen as the President of the eighth Territory Council to succeed Democratic Councilor Serranus Clinton Hastings in that leadership position.\nSummary of results.\nSource:\nExternal links.\nDistrict boundaries for the Iowa Territory Council in 1845:", "Mahoning Drive-In Theater\n\nThe Mahoning Drive-In Theater is a drive-in theater located in Lehighton, Pennsylvania, along Route 443. Opened in 1949, the Mahoning was one of many drive-in theaters that became popular in the United States following World War II. Attendance at the Mahoning waned by 2014, but the theater has since gained a resurgence in popularity due to the management's decision to screen primarily older cult films and B movies rather than newer releases. It is the last remaining drive-in theater in the US to screen films in 35 mm every weekend.\nHistory.\nThe Mahoning Drive-In Theater opened on April 29, 1949, with space for 75 cars, amidst a wave of drive-in theaters that became popular in the US after World War II. A preview showing the night before drew 500 attendees. According to Gene DeSantis, the theater's manager circa 1988, the first film screened at the Mahoning was 1948's \"April Showers\". The first season screened films every night of the week and admission was 50 cents.\nThough drive-in attendance declined across the country with the advent of multiplex theaters in the 1970s and 1980s, the Mahoning remained in operation. In 1997, owner Joe Farruggio courted controversy when he threatened to screen \"Deep Throat\" and \"Debbie Does Dallas\" following multiple rejected zoning applications to build two additional screens. Mahoning Township required the theater to get approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to build the additional screens because of their proximity to an airport, which they did not receive. Police were present before the Friday night screening to confiscate the films, had they been visible from the road, but Farruggio instead elected to show \"Mimic\" and \"Cop Land\". The drive-in was only open for two weeks that year. By 2014, the Mahoning had seen a significant decline in attendance, sometimes with as few as 10 cars per show.\nOwner and projectionist Jeff Mattox (who started working at the Mahoning in 2001) decided, at the suggestion of then-volunteer employees Virgil Cardamone and Matt McClanahan, that the Mahoning would screen primarily older cult films and B movies, as opposed to newer releases. The decision proved successful, and attendance at the Mahoning soon rose in accordance with the addition of Exhumed Films themed programs like the recurring \"Zombie Fest\"\u2014a marathon of films featuring zombies\u2014and \"Camp Blood\"\u2014a marathon of horror films set at summer camps. Films are commonly shown as double or triple features at the Mahoning, and are often accompanied by screenings of older movie trailers, other vintage advertisements, and themed sets and costumes by volunteer James T. Mills. The Mahoning has gone on to host events for Shudder, Joe Bob Briggs, and Troma Entertainment.\nOn July 13, 2021, it was announced that the land on which the theater is situated was optioned by a solar power company, Greenskies Clean Energy LLC, which planned to demolish the Mahoning (including its screen and marquee) and construct a solar farm in its place. Following an outpouring of community support, the plans have been put on hold. In 2024, Mattox passed away less than two weeks before its 75th season was set to begin. Ticket sales and the season opening were paused while the theater's staff sought a way to continue without a business owner. On May 10, 2024, the season began under the operation of Cardamone. The night included a memorial video to Mattox titled, \"The Man Behind the Curtain.\"\nLocation and Facilities.\nThe screen, marquee, concessions building, ticket booth, and projector are all original to the Mahoning, although changes and repairs have been made over the years. The original Mahoning screen was built in 1947 by Bethlehem Steel and measured 70 feet. By 1958 it measured 100 feet and has now expanded to 110 feet. Two weeks before the 2019 season opening, the screen was significantly damaged and underwent approximately $20,000 repairs. The marquee sits at the intersection of Route 443 and Seneca Road to point cars towards the theater entrance a half mile away. In 2018, it was severely damaged by weather and a GoFundMe campaign was launched to help raise the nearly $20,000 it cost to repair the sign. To commemorate the repaired marquee, drive-in volunteers placed a time capsule in one of the posts.\nThe concessions building also houses the projector room and bathroom. The projectors were manufactured in 1947 and have been used at the theater since it opened. 35\u00a0mm prints are sourced both from studios, private collectors, and university libraries. Exhumed Films is also a regular source for prints. The concessions building housed cigarette and pinball machines (both of which were robbed in the 50s and 60s). The mural on the concessions stand was painted by Christian Egbert in 2016, who first learned about the drive-in after meeting staff at a local flea market. Mattox paid for the materials and Egbert was given a place to sell his paintings in exchange for the labor.\nThe Mahoning Drive-In is one of three drive-in movie theaters in the Lehigh Valley, the other two being Becky's Drive-In Theatre and Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre (the oldest operational drive-in in the country, now operated by former Mahoning volunteer owner Matt McClanahan).", "2021\u201322 Russian First Division\n\nThe 2021\u201322 Russian Football National League was the 30th season of Russia's second-tier football league since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

In August of that year, Sharpton announced the formation of an exploratory committee and began to campaign for the nomination of the Democratic Party. Sharpton had previously run for several elected offices throughout the 1990s, and many news outlets reported on how Sharpton was unlikely to gain the Democratic nomination, with some arguing that the primary point of his campaign was to raise his profile. Sharpton claimed that, while he was running with the intent to win, it was more important to him that his campaign help raise issues primarily concerning the African American community, regardless of whether he received the nomination or not.\nIn January 2003, Sharpton officially announced his candidacy and campaigned extensively in the state of South Carolina. However, following a poor showing at the South Carolina primaries, Sharpton announced that he was supporting eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry. However, Sharpton continued to campaign until the Democratic National Convention, where he gave a keynote speech.\nBackground.\nAl Sharpton was born in New York City in 1954. At an early age, he took an interest in religion and was ordained as a Pentecostal minister at the age of 10. In his teenage years, he became involved in politics and activism, and in 1969, he was named the youth director for Operation Breadbasket by civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. In 1972, Sharpton served as the youth director for Shirley Chisholm's 1972 presidential campaign and that same decade he formed the National Youth Movement. Throughout the 1980s, Sharpton became more well known for organizing protests on various issues, and in 1987, he reached national attention for advocating in support of Tawana Brawley, a woman who alleged that six white police officers had raped her. A grand jury later ruled the allegations a hoax and Sharpton was later charged with defamation of an assistant district attorney who had been involved in the case. In 1991, Sharpton founded the civil rights organization the National Action Network (NAN).\nAl Sharpton's first political campaign was in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York, in which he placed third in the Democratic Party primaries. He then ran in the Democratic primaries for the 1994 United States Senate election in New York, which he again lost. In the 1997 New York City mayoral election primaries, Sharpton lost, but garnered almost enough votes to force a runoff election. In 2000, Sharpton again expressed interest in running in the 2001 New York City mayoral election, going as far as stating in December that he was forming an exploratory committee for that reason. However, Sharpton ultimately chose to instead endorse Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer in the primaries.\nEarly stages.\nExpressed interest.\nIn a May 2001 interview with \"Time\", Sharpton expressed interest in running for President of the United States, stating, \"I feel that the Democratic Party must be challenged in 2004 because it didn't fight aggressively to protect our voting rights in Florida. I think we need to look at running a black in the primary. I have said I would be available to do it.\" The article compared Sharpton's possible run to Jesse Jackson's 1984 presidential campaign and argued that Sharpton and Jackson were rivals \"in the struggle for the leadership of black America\". A May 2001 article on \"Salon.com\" compared it to Pat Buchanan's 1992 campaign, implying that it could lead to vote splitting within the Democratic Party. Later that month, Sharpton was sentenced to 90 days in jail for his participation in protests against the U.S. Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico. An August 2001 article in \"The Economist\" stated that while it was unlikely that he would win the Democratic nomination, Sharpton could earn enough support to give him leverage with whoever the eventual nominee would be, a sentiment supported by a report published by the Associated Press (AP). Talking about his prospects from his jail cell, Sharpton said, \"I think people want moral leadership even if they don't agree with their leaders all the time. People are tired of politicians who won't sacrifice themselves for what they believe. The worst that could happen is our issues will get out there. The best that could happen is I could become the Democratic Party's nominee.\" On August 17, Sharpton was released from the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, during which time he had been visited by several politicians, including Jackson, U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, and former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson.\nExploratory committee.\nSpeaking at the Washington Press Club on August 20, 2001, Sharpton announced that he had asked Harvard University Professor Cornel West to form an exploratory committee by November for a possible 2004 campaign. During his speech, Sharpton expressed concern with the movement of the Democratic Party to the right of the political spectrum and again noted the controversial results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election in Florida, which he said was disenfranchisement of African Americans. Sharpton also spoke about the divided state of the African American voting bloc and stated that \"progressive leadership is in a deep crisis at the moment in the Democratic Party and outside\". According to Sharpton, the point of the exploratory committee would be to find \"a strategy that would lead toward making sure the unheard and the unnoticed are both heard and paid attention to\". Additionally, he stated that the focus of his campaign would be on criminal justice reform and electoral reform. At the time of his announcement, BBC News reported that it was unlikely that Sharpton would win the nomination, but that he could become a power broker within the party, a claim that was repeated in several major news outlets. However, journalist Dan Collins stated that, given Sharpton's experience in public policy, his campaign might prove to be more successful than expected. By 2002, the exploratory committee included other notable individuals such as former New Jersey Senate member Sharpe James and Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree and entrepreneur Russell Simmons.\nAlleged smear campaign.\nOn September 23, 2002, multiple news sources reported on a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surveillance tape from 1983 that had surfaced showing Sharpton talking to an undercover agent about a drug deal. The video, which was to be broadcast on HBO's \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\" that night, was part of an investigation into boxing promoter Don King's connections with organized crime and showed Sharpton talking to mobster Michael Franzese and an undercover agent posing as a businessman from Latin America. While the group initially talked about boxing and entertainment promotion, the conversation turned to a cocaine deal that the businessman could include Sharpton in. Sharpton later stated that he was caught off guard and scared by the man, in part because he didn't know if he was armed, and so he agreed to what the person was saying and left. Ultimately, no drug deal came from the conversation. A 1988 article in \"New York Newsday\" claimed that the FBI used the tape as leverage to get Sharpton to act as an informant for them, which Sharpton has denied. Sharpton also alleged that the tape had been leaked by law enforcement officials as a smear campaign to hurt his presidential campaign. The following day, BBC News reported that Sharpton's lawyer would be filing a lawsuit against HBO alleging $500 million in damages. However, news reports from the same day claimed that Sharpton was seeking $1 billion in damages in a suit filed with the New York Supreme Court. Sharpton alleged that the people who aired the tape \"intentionally and maliciously distorted something that ended in an abrupt 'No'\" and that there was a second tape not shown by HBO that showed him telling the undercover agent, \"Don't ever talk to us about a drug deal\". A representative for HBO at the time stated that the lawsuit was \"so silly that it is unworthy of comment\" while defending the journalistic integrity of the show. Sharpton claimed that the alleged smear campaign could actually help his campaign, as it would vindicate his claims that people within the government were intentionally trying to hurt his success.\nLate 2002.\nBy October 2002, Sharpton was the only Democratic candidate with an exploratory committee. In an interview with CBS News that month, he said that he would make a decision by the end of summer 2003 and that while he was leaning towards running, he wanted to make sure that his campaign would bring about some gains even if he was not chosen as the Democratic nominee. He also stated that he was not ruling out the option of running as a third party candidate if he did not win the nomination. In a December 2002 interview with the \"Hartford Courant\", Sharpton talked about some of the additional focuses of his campaign, which included defending affirmative action, expanding Medicare coverage for prescription drugs, and opposing a possible war in Iraq.\nCampaign developments.\nOfficial candidacy.\nAccording to a January 2003 article by the AP, Sharpton filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on December 31, 2002, that officially marked his entry into the race. The AP also reported that on January 5, Sharpton announced his presidential run and campaigned the following day in Boston. By this point, there were already several notable contenders for the Democratic nomination, including U.S. Senators John Edwards, John Kerry, and Joe Lieberman, U.S. Representative Dick Gephardt, and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean. At the time of his announcement, pollsters expressed pessimism at Sharpton's chances of winning the nomination, with an article published later that month in \"The New York Times\" stating that Sharpton was \"trailing in the presidential campaign\". However, a January 13 article by journalist Adam Nagourney in \"The New York Times\" stated that Sharpton had potential to do well in the race and reported that he was planning to form an exploratory committee on January 21. Following this, news sources reported that Sharpton would officially announce his candidacy in the spring. The same day that the exploratory committee was created, Jackson and the five other Democratic candidates all attended an event at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C., held by NARAL Pro-Choice America in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the \"Roe v. Wade\" ruling. NARAL President Kate Michelman called it \"the first major gathering of the announced presidential hopefuls on the Democratic side\".\nOn January 22, the day after Sharpton filed to create an exploratory committee, a fire destroyed his campaign headquarters building, which also served as the headquarters for the NAN. While official reports stated that the fire was caused by an electrical issue, some of Sharpton's supporters alleged that the fire was caused by arson, which had been ruled out by the chief fire marshal. On May 3, Sharpton participated in the first Democratic Party presidential debate for the 2004 election in Columbia, South Carolina. At the time, he was polling at less than 5 percent.\nIn a July 2003 interview on \"Face the Nation\", Sharpton expressed support for reparations for slavery and criticized then-President George W. Bush for his handling of the war in Iraq. He also stated that a cornerstone of his campaign would include three amendments to the U.S. Constitution that would strengthen the right to vote and codify the right to health care and the right to education. An article that same month in the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that while Sharpton was still polling low and had raised only an approximate $114,000, a recent Gallup Poll placed him first among African American voters, at 24 percent support. On July 12, \"The New York Times\" reported that Sharpton was undergoing an income tax audit focusing on several years in the 1990s and that many of the records pertaining to this time were lost in the fire that destroyed his headquarters. The following month, \"Slate\" published an article discussing some of Sharpton's foreign policy stances, which included taking a more amicable approach towards African and Latin American nations and a criticism of the United States as a global policeman.\nDebates and hosting \"Saturday Night Live\".\nIn September, Sharpton was unable to attend a presidential debate in Albuquerque, New Mexico, due to a weather-caused flight delay. However, \"The Washington Post\" published an article at that time that highlighted several other instances when Sharpton was late in arriving to political forums and events. Later that month, Sharpton would participate in debates in Baltimore (September 9) and New York City (September 25). That same month, NBC News reported on Sharpton's campaigning in Southern United States, particularly South Carolina, calling it a \"Southern strategy\" compared to other candidates' focus on states with early primaries, such as Iowa and New Hampshire. A South Carolina newspaper during this time claimed that Sharpton had visited South Carolina more times at this point in the race than any other Democratic candidate. On September 30, \"The New York Times\" published an article stating that Sharpton's campaign was in \"disarray\", noting that both his national campaign manager and his South Carolina coordinator had both resigned. Several weeks later, The New York Times reported that Sharpton's \"campaign has little in the way of organization or infrastructure, relying largely on the generosity of a few wealthy donors\".\nOn October 2, CBS News reported that in Democratic presidential opinion polls, Wesley Clark lead with 14 percent of respondents, while Sharpton was polling at 3 percent, near the bottom of the list of candidates. Sharpton polled low in several other categories as well, though he polled best with the question of who the respondents \"haven't heard\" of. Later that month, after it was reported that Jackson was expected to back Howard Dean for the nomination, Sharpton accused Dean of running on an \"anti-black agenda\" and claimed that he supported the National Rifle Association of America and capital punishment while opposing affirmative action. Dean later denied that he opposed affirmative action. That month, Sharpton also participated in debates in Phoenix, Arizona (October 9) and Detroit (October 26), while the following month, he participated in debates in Boston (November 4) and Des Moines, Iowa (November 24). In early December, commenting on Sharpton's overall performance in the debates, University of Maryland professor Ron Walters said, \"He has stood out in the debates, someone who is quick-witted, who sort of makes people laugh, who has a dominating personality in terms of dealing with crisis when they arise in the debate format. I think a lot of that plays to his acumen as a Baptist preacher and somebody who's very comfortable in this kind of a setting.\"\nIn early November, a number of news sources reported that Sharpton had been contracted to host the December 6 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" on NBC. According to Sharpton, show producer Lorne Michaels told him that his appearance would be apolitical, and an aide for Sharpton stated that the campaign was not helping Sharpton prepare for the show. However, an article published in \"The New York Times\" at this time claimed that the show was \"a vehicle that, while not a proven vote getter, certainly brings him nationwide attention\". On December 5, CNN reported that NBC affiliates in several states may opt out of showing the episode out of concern for adhering to the equal-time rule set forth by the Federal Communications Commission. All four NBC affiliates in Iowa opted out of airing the episode, which featured Sharpton in skits portraying Johnnie Cochran and one of the biblical magi. Several days later, Sharpton participated in a debate at the University of New Hampshire (December 9).\nEarly 2004.\nIn early January 2004, journalist Michael Slackman of \"The New York Times\" reported discrepancies in the Sharpton campaign's finances and again noted Sharpton's ongoing audit and previous incidents of financial mismanagement on Sharpton's behalf. Later that month, the newspaper reported that noted conservative political consultant Roger Stone was involved with the Sharpton campaign in an undisclosed manner. Stone previously served as a consultant with Republican presidential candidates including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and Bush. Around the same time, alternative newspaper \"The Village Voice\" reported on the relationship, noting that Stone had helped the campaign apply for matching funds with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and aided in staffing. \"The Village Voice\" criticized the relationship and alleged that Stone may have had ulterior motives in aiding Sharpton, while \"Salon.com\" claimed that Stone's involvement in the campaign \"should disgust his [Sharpton's] constituents\". Through the month, Sharpton continued to campaign extensively in South Carolina. However, in the aftermath of the South Carolina primary, Sharpton did not receive a single delegate and did not receive a significant amount of the African American vote.\nWithdrawal and Democratic National Convention.\nOn March 15, Sharpton announced that he was endorsing Democratic front-runner Kerry for president, but he would still continue his own campaign \"to promote issues of concern to minority voters\". Later that month, the FEC announced they were initiating a process to suspend matching funds for Sharpton's campaign due to rules violations. In June, Sharpton attended the Democratic National Convention as a speaker, wherein he attacked Bush and promoted the Democratic nominee. His speech garnered a standing ovation.\nAftermath.\nIn December 2005, Sharpton agreed to pay back over $100,000 in matching funds he had received during the campaign. In November 2008, \"Politico\" reported that the FEC had fined Sharpton close to half a million dollars due to illegal contributions he had received during the campaign. Throughout the 2010s and 2020s, several conservative news outlets reported that Sharpton was approximately $900,000 in debt from expenses related to the campaign.", "Alf Busk\n\nAlf Busk (born 16 April 1958) is a Danish former speedway rider.

The crime was never solved.\nBackground.\nKate Jackson (1885\u20131929) was a mysterious woman who claimed to be born in India and told her husband she was the author Ethel M. Dell. A birth certificate gave the name Kate Atkinson, born in Lancashire the daughter of Agnes and John Atkinson. She said she had purchased this from a girl, but this appears to be her true identity.\nIn her teens around 1904 she went to London hoping to become an actress. She lived as common law wife to a Leopold le Grys and styled herself \"Mollie le Grys\".\nIn 1914 she began a con trick on a George Harrison which began with her fainting in his presence after a minor car accident at Charing Cross Road she got him to take her to lunch. This turned into an affair. She told Harrison she was pregnant and asked \u00a340 for an abortion. He paid this, but she began repeatedly asking for sums and it effectively turned into blackmail. A weekly payment of \u00a330 became normal. However, Harrison paid this by embezzling funds from his workplace.\nShe married Tom Jackson, a war veteran, in Cardiff around 1919. It is unclear how they met. She gave multiple stories of her origins. They initially lived in Kate's property: a farmhouse in Surrey. They had an adopted daughter, Betty. Around 1927 they moved to a small remote bungalow in the Mumbles in south Wales. She told the neighbours her name was Kate but Tom and close friends still called her Mollie.\nKate lived quite extravagantly for a fishmonger's wife and appeared to live beyond her theoretical means, indicating some hidden wealth or unknown income. Every Wednesday she received a letter containing \u00a330 cash from a source unknown to her husband - George Harrison. This long-running blackmail was revealed in 1927 when Harrison was put on trial for embezzling \u00a319000. He claimed \u00a38000 of this was to supply the regular payments to the woman he knew as Mollie le Grys. Whilst this did not bring her a fortune, it was far above the average weekly wage, and it allowed her many additional comforts. However, as with any crime of this nature, it had a potential to backfire, and Kate lived in fear of this.\nThe Incident.\nOn Monday 4 February 1929, on Plunch Lane, in the tiny hamlet of Limeslade on the edge of The Mumbles, Jackson was attacked.\nJust after 10pm, Jackson and her neighbour Olive Dimick were returning from the Tivoli Cinema, having left home together at 6pm. Olive has only just said goodbye to Kate when she heard her scream. She went outside and found Kate near the back door of Kate's neighbouring bungalow \"Kenilworth\", with her husband bent over her. She was bleeding from the head and barely conscious. They moved her to the back door. Olive saw that Tom was in his underwear and told him to get dressed. Olive's husband Sydney arrived, as did another neighbour, Rose Gammon.\nMr Jackson reappeared with clothes on and Mrs Gammon offered to call for a doctor, but he declined saying he would fetch someone if she got worse. As Kate was bleeding from the head this was strangely complacent. Tom eventually went to another neighbour Mrs Janet Philips and phoned Dr Neil Seddon Taylor of the Mumbles who agreed to come out. They met at Boyle's Garage, 100m from their house. Tom told Mrs Philips that Kate had recently received threatening letters regarding an embezzlement trial two years previously.\nThe doctor arrived and found that Kate's wounds were very serious. He shaved back her hair and stitched the more serious wounds. She complained that this hurt. She did not reply when questioned who did it, but then uttered a single, but inexplicable word: \"gorse\". She repeated this three or four times.\nThe doctor told Tom to call the local hospital, call a taxi to get there, and call the police to report the incident. He went to Mrs Philips, but only called a taxi. On return the doctor said the hospital would only admit her with prior notification. This time Tom went to a different neighbour (perhaps not to disturb Mrs Philips a third time): John Skidmore who lived at Marydale bungalow to the south. He told Skidmore that his wife had been attacked on her way back from the pictures (i.e. Cinema).\nThe taxi arrived and the driver helped get Kate onto the back seat then drove with Tom to the hospital. The doctor followed in his own car. They went to Swansea General Hospital. Tom did not stay at the hospital, but went back to Limeslade with the taxi driver. He had gone by the time hospital staff arrived to interview him about the incident. They informed the police a little after 3am and they then called Dr Taylor for more details. They went to the hospital then to Limeslade to interview Tom, arriving a little before 5am. Tom was slow to answer the door.\nThe police found broken glass in the pool of blood near the back door. Tom claimed he heard a noise at 10.45pm and found Kate near the back door just as Olive ran up.\nMrs Philip only became aware of the seriousness of the attack through the police. Olive said Kate had a fear of strange cars and there was one opposite their house on the night in question.\nSuperintendent Harry Fox of Mumbles arrived later in the morning and was joined by Detective inspector Frederick William Gough and the Chief Constable, Captain Thomas Rawson.\nRevelations.\nAn x-ray revealed Kate had a fractured skull. There were at least nine separate wounds on her head.\nPress descending on Limeslade quickly discovered that Kate was \"Madame X\" a mystery witness in a London embezzlement trial involving a man called Harrison who had embezzled the money on her behalf.\nBoth Tom and the neighbour Olive confirmed that Kate had a deep fear of being discovered and had wanted to live in Limeslade due to its remoteness.\nPolice guards stayed with Mrs Jackson in the hospital hoping she would recover enough to name her assailant. On Saturday 9 February she became lucid and was able to answer questions. The police interviewed her at noon but gleaned no useful information.\nHer condition deteriorated overnight. A final attempt was made to interview her. She died just after noon on 10 February. The official cause of death was a heart attack brought about by the trauma.\nAs the only suspect, Tom was charged with murder two weeks after the death and put on trial in July. A tyre lever had been found concealed in the kitchen but there was no positive evidence whatsoever to link Tom to the crime nor was any motive evidenced. The judge told the jury he saw no evidence of a third party involvement. Tom's nonchalant attitude did not help things and is not easily explained. However he had nothing to gain by her death. He was found not guilty in July 1929. The media generally supported this viewpoint.\nThe word \"gorse\" was never explained. In terms of the story as a whole it may have been \"grys\" rather than \"gorse\". Perhaps Leopold Le Grys also held a grudge. Leopold le Grys certainly existed: he was born in 1876, lived and worked in London as a portrait artist and died in Kensington in 1971. He married Adal Collins in 1922.", "Goddess of the Night (Hurrian)\n\nGoddess of the Night (, DINGIR.GE6) was a deity worshiped in the Hurrian kingdom of Kizzuwatna, and later also in \u0160amu\u1e2ba in the Hittite Empire. Only the logographic writing of her name is known, and multiple attempts at identifying her have been made. Most researchers assume that she was at least partially similar to goddesses such as Ishtar, \u0160au\u0161ka and I\u0161\u1e2bara. She most likely represented the night sky, and was also associated with dreaming. \nKnown texts indicate that the Goddess of the Night was closely associated with Pinikir, an astral goddess of Elamite origin also worshiped by the Hurrians. They appear together in the same rituals, including a well preserved text dealing with the preparations of a new temple of the Goddess of the Night.\nName.\nThe name of the Goddess of the Night (alternatively the Deity of the Night) is conjectural, as only the logographic writing is known. The most common writing, DINGIR.GE6, uses exclusively Sumerian signs, but variants with Akkadian complementation, DINGIR-LUM GE6-\u0160I and DINGIR-LIM GE6, as well as a mixed Sumero-Akkadian writing, DINGIR-LIM MU-\u0160I, are also known. No phonetic writings are attested. The gender of the deity designated by this name was only possible to establish due to the fact she is described wearing typically feminine headwear and a single instance where a distinct feminine form of an Akkadian verb is used to address her.\nEarly researchers, starting with Hans Ehelolf in 1936, assumed that the deity represented by the logogram DINGIR.GE6 should be understood as a \"black god\" or \"black goddess.\" This view was still accepted as late as in 1989. It led to a number of now discarded proposals regarding the nature of DINGIR.GE6, including an attempt at relating her to an epithet of Aphrodite Urania from Cyprus, \"melania\", \"the black,\" attested in Roman sources from the time of Sulla.\nThe correct reading was first established by in 1968, though it was not instantly adopted by other authors. It was subsequently confirmed by the discovery of alternate spellings clarifying that GE6 represents the word \"night,\" rather than any other readings of the same cuneiform sign, leading to the modern consensus.\nProposed identification.\nThe origin and identity of the Goddess of the Night are a matter of scholarly debate. Piotr Taracha considers her a deity of Hurrian origin. Gary Beckman suggests that it is possible ritual texts related to her, as well as these dealing with Kumarbi and the so-called \"Former Gods,\" have their origin in \"Sumero-Hurrian\" culture of northern Syria and the \"transtigridian\" area of the late third and early second millennium BCE. Jared L. Miller presumes that she originated in Kizzuwatna. He argues that no other deity representing the night is known from Syria or Mesopotamia, with the exception of the poetic phrase \"gods of the night\" (\"il\u016b mu\u0161\u012bti\" or \"il\u0101n\u012b mu\u0161\u012bti\") which referred to stars and planets. However, a deity named Mu\u0161\u012btu (written in cuneiform as \"dmu-\u0161\u012b-tu4 or dmu-\u0161\u012b-ti\"), \"night,\" was worshiped in Emar in association with Saggar. Since she appears in a Hurrian ritual, Alfonso Archi considers it possible her name was a mistaken writing of an unrelated theonym, Mu\u0161uni, \"order.\" According to Frans Wiggermann, in Mesopotamian texts night (Akkadian: \"mu\u0161\u012btu\") could be sporadically personified and was described as a \"veiled bride,\" but the word even in this context was not accompanied by the dingir sign denoting divinity. Daniel Schwemer nonetheless argues that she should be considered a deity. In one case the personified night occurs alongside deities such as Ea and the Sebitti in a ritual for dream incubation. She is also mentioned in \"Maql\u00fb\", and an ancient commentary on this work identifies her with Gula. A further fragment might suggest the identification between the Mesopotamian personified night and Ishtar, but the restoration is uncertain.\nRen\u00e9 Lebrun proposed in 1976 proposed that the Goddess of the Night is to be identified with the dI\u0160TAR of \u0160amu\u1e2ba (sometimes referred to as \"\u0160au\u0161ka of \u0160amu\u1e2ba\"). This view was subsequently also adopted by Gary Beckman, who points out that calling the Goddess of the Night the \"dI\u0160TAR of \u0160amu\u1e2ba \" would be similar to referring to the well attested phenomenon of calling \u0160au\u0161ka the \"dI\u0160TAR of Nineveh.\" According to Jared R. Miller this view is commonly accepted by other modern researchers. However, he does not consider this theory convincing himself. He remarks that it is not impossible there was already an Ishtar hypostasis ( Ishtar of Tamininga) in \u0160amu\u1e2ba before Goddess of the Night was brought to that city from Kizzuwatna by either Tudhaliya I or Tudhaliya II.) He argues it is not impossible that it was this goddess who came to known as the Ishtar of \u0160amu\u1e2ba , and that the Goddess of the Night and Ishtar of \u0160amu\u1e2ba were worshiped separately from each other instead of being two interchangeable names of one goddess. Beate Pongratz-Leisten also considers Goddess of the Night and the deity of \u0160amu\u1e2ba to be separate. A proposal that the Goddess of the Night was the astral aspect of the Mesopotamian Ishtar, or the planet Venus, gained some traction in scholarship, but no direct evidence is available in favor of this view, and it remains uncertain if Ishtar, her hypostases and related deities were actually understood as astral deities in Bronze Age Anatolia. Piotr Taracha similarly identifies Goddess of the Night with Pinikir. However, this view is not supported by other researchers. In offering lists, they can appear side by side as separate deities.\nIn the 1970s it has been suggested that the Hittite deities I\u0161panza\u0161epa or I\u0161panza known from other documents might correspond to the Goddess of the Night. I\u0161panzasepa, whose name means \"genius of the night,\" was worshiped by the Hittites during the KI.LAM festival and formed a pair with a moon deity, most likely Arma, in it, while I\u0161pant, \"night,\" was among the deities associated with Kanesh in Hittite texts. Piotr Taracha considers these two figures to be related. However, the view that either of them was the same as the Goddess of the Night is doubted, chiefly because the position of the latter in the pantheon of Kizzuwatna was relatively high, while the former belonged to the category of minor deities.\nIn the Late Hittite period in some cases the same logographic writing, DINGIR.GE6, could represent the Luwian moon god Arma, for example in the writing of a number of theophoric names, in which d30 (Arma) might alternate with DINGIR.GE6. While the assumption that it means these two deities are identical is present in some older publications, it is unlikely that the Goddess of the Night was confused with him or shared his lunar character, as no known hypostasis of Ishtar (or similar goddesses) was associated with the moon.\nWhile Ahmet \u00dcnan concluded that Goddess of the Night (who he refers to as the \"Goddess of Darkness\" instead) was a form of Lamashtu, and describes her as possessing \"thoroughly demonic traits,\" this view found no acceptance among other researchers. Richard H. Beal criticizes it as rooted in an incorrect interpretation of a fragmentary text (KUB 55.24), which deals with a nightmare merely experienced in a temple of the Goddess of the Night, which is unlikely to describe the goddess herself on the account of her character as a \"respectable deity.\" Jared R. Miller agrees with this position as well, and points out that Beal's assumption would match what is known about other similar texts describing dream omens.\nCharacter and iconography.\nGoddess of the Night was most likely understood as a divine representation of the night sky. She was also associated with dreaming. It is also possible she was regarded as a chthonic deity, as she was sometimes invoked through ritual pits (\"abi\").\nAccording to ritual texts, the Goddess of the Night was believed to wear a white or red \"kure\u0161\u0161ar\", a type of shawl commonly worn as head-wear by Hittite women. Together with the use of Akkadian signs representing a second person feminine form of the verb \"to love\" (\"tar\u00e2m\u012b\") in a passage referring to her sympathy for specific locations this fact is regarded as proof that she was a goddess rather than a god. However, while addressed as female, in the same text she receives both feminine and masculine sets of clothing, which according to Jared L. Miller might point to a partially ambiguous identity. Richard H. Beal suggests that they indicate the goddess was presumed to crossdress. Gary Beckman notes that \"ambiguous gender identification\" was sometimes a characteristic of the category of Ishtar-like goddesses, to which according to him the Goddess of the Night belonged.\nIn addition to the aforementioned articles of clothing, a text dealing with creation of a new temple for Goddess of the Night enumerates a variety of objects a new statue of her had to be equipped with: multiple brooches made out of silver and iron (at the time regarded as a precious metal), ivory combs, musical instruments, a bronze basin used to \"bathe\" her, stools, tables, and woolen tapestries in five colors meant to provide the statue with privacy when necessary. The statue itself had to be made out of gold encrusted with a variety of precious and semi-precious stones such as carnelian, lapis, alabaster and \"Babylon stone\" (cast glass). The statue's navel and a pair of \"purka\" (an unidentified body part) were apparently separate, also golden, objects. She was also to be accompanied by a golden disk representing Pinikir. Gary Beckman notes that it is likely many cult images were much less complex than this depiction of Goddess of the Night must have been. \nAssociations with other deities.\nMuch of the available evidence indicates that Goddess of the Night was associated in some way with Ishtar. For example, a Hittite oracular text lists two hypostases of Goddess of the Night among various hypostases of Ishtar, and contains a question asking if \"any Ishtars\" are angry. An invocation from a ritual text focused on the Goddess of the Night list cult centers of Ishtar (Agade, Babylon and Hursagkalama, an alternate name of Kish). It has been pointed out that the list of cities preserved in this ritual, as well as the information about the worship of Pinikir contained in it, most likely indicates that the scholarly tradition of Kizzuwatna involved the transfer of Mesopotamian knowledge. Possibly the compilers had access to an earlier document similar to the \"Canonical Temple List\" from the Kassite period. However, it cannot necessarily be assumed that all of the traits of the Goddess of the Night were identical with these of Ishtar. \nIn addition to Ishtar, the Goddess of the Night has also been compared to Hurrian \u0160au\u0161ka. However, a notable difference between them in known ritual texts is the fact that the former was never associated with Nineveh. A number of similarities between the Goddess of the Night and I\u0161\u1e2bara have been pointed out too, chiefly their shared association with the underworld and with Ishtar. \nGoddess of the Night and Pinikir.\nGoddess of the Night was particularly closely associated with Pinikir, an Elamite goddess who was also worshiped by Hurrians. She was viewed as a personification of Venus, and as such was associated with Ishtar. A god list from Emar equates her with Ninsianna. Goddess of the Night and Pinikir seemingly functioned as a dyad. The worship of duos of deities with similar domains (for example Allani and I\u0161\u1e2bara or Ninatta and Kulitta) as if they were one was a common feature of Hurrian religion. In a ritual preceding her transfer to a new temple, Goddess of the Night is summoned from cities associated with Ishtar, but also from locations where Pinikir was worshiped (Susa, Elam). A golden disk attached to the back of a statue of Goddess of the Night in the same ritual likely represented Pinikir. The statue and the gold disc together can be interpreted as a \"rendering of night sky with its luminaries.\" According to the same text, Pinikir received a \"keldi\" (so-called \"goodwill offering\") identical to that dedicated to the Goddess of the Night, though located on the roof rather than on the temple. In another text, which deals with ritual purification, the same rites were performed for them both.\nWorship.\nThe Goddess of the Night was worshiped in Kizzuwatna. Various members of clergy dedicated to her are attested in known texts, including SANGA priests, two of whom, Il\u012b-ma-ab\u012b and Ulippi are known by name. Additionally, the term \"katra\" or \"katri\" denoted a class of clergy involved in the worship of both of this goddess (as well as I\u0161\u1e2bara). One \"katra\" known by name was Arazakiti. She apparently was a co-author of one of the ritual texts pertaining to the Goddess of the Night.\nDuring the reign of either Tudhaliya I or Tudhaliya II the Goddess of the Night was also introduced to Hittite lands, where the city of \u0160amu\u1e2ba, most likely located near modern Sivas, became her new cult center. She was also worshiped in La\u1e2b\u1e2burama.\nA well known text, the \"Expansion of the Goddess of the Night\", describes the transfer of this deity to a new temple in detail. It is considered to be one of the best preserved Hittite rituals. The procedure started with the building of a new temple, and the fashioning of a new statue and various paraphernalia for it. After they were finished, purification water from the original temple had to be brought to the new one and was kept on its roof for a day. The goddess herself was summoned from various locations and a string representing the path she had to take to reach her new dwelling had to be tied to the statue after the completion of this part of the preparations. In addition to the Goddess of the Night, the closely associated Pinikir also had to receive offerings during them.", "Jack Sheridan (hurler)\n\nJack Sheridan (born 1997) is an Irish hurler.

They decided however to sell Vietka and build an estate in Chal\u010d. The construction of the manor complex was completed in the early 19th century.\nThe Chaleckis owned the manor until 1812. When Napoleon came to Belarus, they took his side. After the defeat of the French army by Russia, the Chaleckis went into exile.

The structure, which is the headquarters of Saffron Walden Town Council, is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory.\nThe current building was commissioned to replace a medieval town hall in the Market Place: several tenement buildings were demolished at the same time so that there would be more room for holding markets. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the mayor, William Mapletoft, in 1761. It was designed in the neoclassical style, built in red brick and was completed in 1763. The design of the original building involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto the Market Place; the central section of three bays, which slightly projected forward and was rusticated on the ground floor, featured three arched openings, each with a wrought-iron grill; on the first floor there was a tall round headed sash window flanked by two conventional sash windows with blind panels above and, at roof level, there was a modillioned cornice, a parapet and a central turret. Internally, the principal room was the courtroom and there was also a lock-up for petty criminals.\nLocal government in towns was reformed in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, with Saffron Walden becoming a municipal borough. The town hall continued to serve as headquarters of the reformed council. The courtroom was converted to serve as a council chamber in 1836 and new lock-up facilities were created at the back of the town hall in 1840.\nIn October 1877, a local businessman, George Stacey Gibson, offered to pay for the remodelling of the town hall. The work involved a large new porch designed by Edward Burgess in the Tudor style which was officially opened by the mayor, Joseph Bell, who accepted the keys from Gibson, on 1 October 1879. The design of the porch, which was timber-framed on the upper floors, involved a three-opening loggia on the ground floor and a prominent bay window on the first floor flanked by brackets supporting a pediment containing a smaller window and a coat of arms in the tympanum. Following the remodelling, the principal rooms were the council chamber and the assembly room. Pevsner liked the design which he described as \"ostentatious\" but worthy of \"an honourable mention\".\nAs the council's responsibilities grew it needed more office accommodation than was available in the town hall. In 1934 the council bought a large house nearby at 5 Hill Street to serve as its offices. The town hall continued to be used for council meetings.\nThe initial stages of the trial of Major Oliver Smedley for the alleged manslaughter of the band manager, Reginald Calvert, took place in the town hall in July 1966; Smedley was founded to have acted in self-defence and was acquitted.\nThe town hall continued to serve as the meeting place of the borough council until it was abolished in 1974 and replaced by Uttlesford District Council, which initially established its headquarters at the former Saffron Walden Rural District council offices in Debden Road. The town hall instead became the meeting place of the parish-level Saffron Walden Town Council, created as a successor parish covering the same area as the abolished borough.\nThe BBC Radio programme \"Any Questions?\" was broadcast from the town hall in May 2011. As a cost saving measure, Saffron Walden Town Council relocated its staff, who had previously been based in offices in Emson Close, into the town hall in October 2020.\nWorks of art in the town hall include portraits by Dani\u00ebl Mijtens of King Charles I and of Queen Henrietta and a portrait by Henry Scott Tuke of the benefactor of the town hall, George Stacey Gibson.", "The OBGMs\n\nThe OBGMs (The oOohh Baby Gimme Mores) are a Canadian punk rock band from Toronto, Ontario.

The local pronunciation is ' \"Chew-R\" '. The earliest surviving mention of the townland is on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map of the Barony of Loughtee, where it is spelled \"Anture\". A 1610 grant spells it as \"Anture\". A 1611 grant spells it as \"Ardea\". An Inquisition dated 30 September 1628 spells it as \"Antnar\". The 1654 Commonwealth Survey spells it as \"Ture\". The 1660 Books of Survey and Distribution spell it as \"Ture\". The 1661 Inquisitions spell it as \"Antoore alias Antuer\" and \"Anture\". The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as \"Anlure\".\nGeography.\nTure is bounded on the north by Ardue townland, on the east by Clowney townland, on the south by Ballyhugh and Clonamullig townlands and on the west by Cranaghan and Greaghrahan townlands. Its chief geographical features are Killywilly Lough, Clonamullig Lough, which lakes contain a wide variety of coarse fish, a small rivulet, woods &amp; plantations and drumlin hills which reach a height of 234 feet above sea-level. The townland is traversed by the National Secondary N87 road (Ireland), minor roads &amp; lanes. Ture has an area of 242 acres, including 33 acres of water.\nHistory.\nAn Ulster Plantation grant of the 'Manor of Monaghan', dated 21 June 1610, from King James VI and I to Sir Hugh Wyrral, a native of Enfield, Essex, England, included one poll of \"Anture\". On 2 December 1628 the Manor of Monaghan, including Ture, was re-granted to Sir Edward Bagshawe of Finglas, who then renamed the estate as Castle Bagshaw. Bagshaw's daughter, Anne, married Thomas Richardson of Dublin, son of John Richardson, bishop of Ardagh, and the marriage settlement dated 28 May 1654 transferred the estate to the married couple. The 1654 Commonwealth Survey states the proprietor of \"Ture\" was 'Mr Thomas Richardson'. On 30 April 1661 the Richardsons sold part of the estate, including one poll of \"Anture\", to Captain Ambrose Bedell of Carn, Tullyhunco, County Cavan. Bedell, by his will dated 20 June 1682 and proved in Dublin 20 October 1683, devised, inter alia his lands in \"Antner\", first to his nephew James Bedell and his heirs male; and failing such to his nephew Ambrose Bedell (James Bedell's next brother) and his heirs male; and, failing such, to his (the testator's) heirs next in blood to his father William Bedell, late Lord Bishop of Kilmore.\nHenry Patterson of Ture is a party to a deed dated 24 Feb 1776.\nA deed by George Montgomery dated 2 September 1780 grants lands in \"Ture\" to Roseanna Patterson, widow of Ture, and Alexander Pringle of \"Ballyhue\".\nThe Tithe Applotment Books for 1833 list four tithepayers in the townland: Montgomery, Storey, Patterson and Jones.\nThe Ture Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1838.\nGriffith's Valuation of 1857 lists three occupiers in the townland: Reilly, Storey and Berry.\nThe 19th century land occupation history is set out in the 1880 court case, 'Montgomery versus Storey'.\nGreaghrahan National School.\nThis was opened on 31 May 1961 to replace an earlier school in Greaghrahan townland and so retained the former name, although located in a different townland. The new building was a vast improvement with running water and flushing toilets. In the 1970s the school was further modernised, with the installation of electric lighting. The schoolyard was re-surfaced and a teachers\u2019 carpark was provided. In 1987 it became a three teacher school and a prefab was erected on the site. In 2005 it was completely refurbished, to include three modern spacious classrooms with toilets, learning support rooms and general purpose room. Outside facilities include two large playing courts for games, a large tarmacadam play area and a spacious green area. In recent years the play area has been further enhanced by the erection of a trim trail or mini obstacle course and a CL\u00c1R funded multi-use soft play area with equipment.\nCensus.\nIn the 1901 census of Ireland, there was one family listed in the townland.\nIn the 1911 census of Ireland, there was one family listed in the townland.\nIn 1995 there were three families in the townland.\nReferences.\nSources:\nMcGuinn, J., ed.

In 1979, rather than recording the fifth and final album due to Columbia Records, Snow had asked the label for release. Snow negotiated with Polydor Records in the spring of 1980, but would sign a two-album deal with newly formed Mirage Records in October 1980, having reportedly commenced recording sessions for her sixth studio album over the summer.\nSnow's aspiration for her album \"Rock Away\" was what had been the failed aspiration for Snow's 1978 \"Against the Grain\" album - and would remain Snow's purported lifelong aspiration - : to trump her \"wintry pop-folk-jazz chanteuse\" musical persona with that of a \"red-hot blues-and-rock-belting mama\". Produced by Greg Ladanyi - who had notably helmed albums by Jackson Browne and Warren Zevon- \"Rock Away\" featured Snow covering R&amp;B-style songs - including her personal choice of the Don Covay number \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" - and vintage Rod Stewart (\"Gasoline Alley\") as well as introducing three Snow originals (Snow judging that two of the five songs she wrote for the album were subpar). The Snow originals include the title cut which - despite being entitled \"Rock Away\" - is a \"sparse acoustic song [with] a genuine pastoral feel...the only [track] featuring Snow on guitar...significantly, it's the [album's] only understated song\".\nThe majority of recording sessions for \"Rock Away\" took place at Manhattan's Power Plant and featured members of Billy Joel's band: Joel's wife Elizabeth Joel was then managing Snow, although that association had ended by the release of \"Rock Away\". \"Games\", the track released as an advance single in February 1981 was recorded at Record One (LA), featuring such stalwart LA session players as keyboardist Bill Payne, drummer Russ Kunkel, and electric guitarists Danny Kortchmar and Waddy Wachtel.\nCritical reception.\n\"Rock Away\" was released in March 1981 to mixed reviews: Jack Lloyd of the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" opined \"Miss Snow departs sharply from her long-standing pattern with this one...And the results are generally pleasing. There is a hard edge that borders on rock in much of the music. Among the high spots are 'Cheap Thrills', 'Baby Please', 'Games' and 'Down in the Basement'. The harder-hitting songs are balanced by ballads that come close to Vintage Snow: 'Something Good' and 'I Believe in You' [the latter an inspirational Bob Dylan number]. The one most ill-advised number is 'Gasoline Alley', [which] simply does not suit Snow's voice.\" Don Reynolds of \"Dayton Daily News\" assessed \"Rock Away\" as having \"its weak moments, but ...still a delight. [Her] unique, husky voice...in fine form[, Snow] shows excellent taste in choosing cover material...But the real gems here are a trio of Snow originals, two gorgeous ballads...and the darkly humorous rocker: 'Down in the Basement'.\"\nCritiquing \"Rock Away\" for Newhouse News service, George Kanzler would write: \"[Snow's] talent [has] found its best expression in ballads and soft rockers, songs with space for Snow to stretch out her amazingly supple and expressive voice [which] has the ability...to get to the heart of a song and to pull those heart strings in herself and in the listener\":\"Snow is not a very good rock singer, and her continued attempts at the genre are a profligate waste of prodigious natural and developed talent.\" Similarly Steve Libowitz of the \"Bridgewater Courier-News\" opined: \"[Snow's] initial foray into\" \"a more rocking style\" - the 1978 album \"Against the Grain\" - \"[did] not [do] well artistically or commercially. 'Rock Away' is her boldest step yet in this direction, and it's just as misguided...As a balladeer, Snow is almost without peer, but she should leave rock-&amp;-roll to those who can handle it. [Her] compelling timbre has been replaced by a grating wail. There's no reason to tackle this sort of material when you have the equipment for much more sophisticated styles.\"\n\"Rock Away\" also disappointed \"Washington Post\" critic Geoffrey Himes, despite Himes sharing Snow's own belief in her rock music acumen: \"[Though] Snow [is perceived] as a sensitive singer-songwriter\"\"because she had a hit with...the [Joni] Mitchellesque \"Poetry Man\"...her real talent [has proven to be] for Bonnie Raitt-like vocal interpretations of rock and soul songs.\" Himes' evaluation was that on \"Rock Away\" the \"powerful, persistent emotional impulses [of Snow's voice] are roped in and weighed down by the easy-listening sentiments of [her] producers [who] saddle Snow with the kind of pop-rock that plods along without disruption or challenge. Fortunately, Snow is able to escape their restraints to create some special moments on the album.\"\nSnow's own eventual verdict on \"Rock Away\" would be: \"The rock-&amp;-roll thing worked and it didn't work - something was still missing.\"\nImpact/ aftermath.\n\"Games\", the February 1981 advance single release from \"Rock Away\", would become Snow's most successful \"Billboard\" Hot 100 entry since \"Poetry Man\" - except for her Top 30 duet with Paul Simon: \"Gone at Last\" - while remaining a Top 40 shortfall, peaking at #46. \"Games\" was significantly less successful on the singles charts of the music industry journals \"Cash Box\" and \"Record World\", with respective peaks of #80 ' and #86 Despite the under-performance of its advance single and the lack of strong reviews, the album \"Rock Away\" - released in March 1981 - by its fifth week on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart had become Snow's highest-charting album since her Top 30 1976 album release: \"It Looks Like Snow\", although \"Rock Away\" would in its eighth charting week peak no higher than #51. (The album charts in \"Cash Box\" and \"Record World\" would afford \"Rock Away\" respective peaks of #86 and #91.)\n\"Rock Away\" would fail to derive significant fresh impetus from its second single release: \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\", released in May 1981 to stall at #52 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: as with \"Games\", \"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\" was less successful on the singles charts in \"Cash Box\" and \"Record World\" with respective peaks of #75 and #78. Also Snow had to abruptly drop promoting \"Rock Away\" in June 1981 after suffering a vocal injury, a concert date in Denver incurring a burst capillary due to the altitude, with Snow's recuperation necessitating the cancelation of 28 scheduled concert gigs along with another promo. Snow would claim this debacle soured her relationship with Mirage Records who declared the tracks recorded for the second album Snow owed the label to lack commercial potential\"I went back on my hands and knees [to Mirage], but they told me to shop it elsewhere.\" \"So I walked away from my second deal\" - Mirage was actually Snow's third label affiliation - \"It was not the most comfortable way of doing it, but it...gave me a sabbatical\", Snow being without a label affiliation until 1988 when she signed with Elektra Records, for whom her seventh studio album: \"Something Real\", would not be released until 1989.\nTrack listing.\nSide one\nSide two\nPersonnel.\nSession players/ singers\nSession players/ singers (cont.) \nProduction", "Shahana Hanif\n\nShahana K. Hanif (born February 5, 1991) is an American politician who is a member of the New York City Council for the 39th district, which covers Park Slope and other neighborhoods in central Brooklyn.\nEarly life.\nHanif was born and raised in Kensington, Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant parents from Bangladesh. She graduated from Bishop Kearney High School and went on to receive her B.A. from Brooklyn College.\nAt age 17, Hanif was diagnosed with lupus, an incurable and potentially fatal autoimmune disease. Hanif has cited her experience with the chronic illness, which forced her to navigate the healthcare system for years despite having inadequate health insurance, as her first window into disability justice and community organizing.\nCareer.\nHanif began her career working as a community organizer with CAAAV Organizing Asian Communities, where she spent two years building tenant power with Bangladeshi and other Asian NYCHA residents.\nHanif began working for Councilman Brad Lander in 2017, first as his liaison to the Bangladeshi community and eventually as his director of organizing and community engagement. During her time working for Lander, Hanif helped a Bangladeshi woman escape a forced marriage, which she cited as an important factor in her eventual decision to run for the New York City Council herself.\nNew York City Council.\nIn late 2019, with her boss Lander facing term limits, Hanif announced her intention to run for the City Council's 39th district in 2021. The district, which had previously been represented by Mayor Bill de Blasio and which was soon to promote Lander to the City Comptroller's office, was described as a \"political launching pad\" by \"Gotham Gazette\".\nHanif faced six other candidates in the June 2021 Democratic primary, most notable among them activist Brandon West. Hanif and West both ran on similar left-wing policy platforms, but West received the support of the Democratic Socialists of America and other socialist elected officials, while Hanif was backed by the Working Families Party and other more traditional progressive organizations; Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, issued an unusual dual endorsement of both candidates.\nOn election night, Hanif held a 32-23% advantage over West. When absentee ballots and ranked-choice votes were counted two weeks later, Hanif emerged with a 57-43% lead, and declared victory on July 3. She faced minimal opposition in the November general election, and handily won the race, making her the first Muslim woman and the first Bangladeshi American elected to the New York City Council and the first woman to represent the 39th district. The final tally showed that she had 89% of the vote.\nHousing.\nIn 2022, Hanif pushed to reduce the number of housing units that could be built on a rezoned block in Gowanus, Brooklyn. The original plan proposed to allow the construction of buildings that were 95 feet and nine stories, but after Hanif's intervention, the lot only allowed for 55 feet and five stories. The lower height limit was likely to reduce the number of affordable housing units in the buildings, in part because developers are required to include affordable units when they exceed a certain size.\nIn 2025, Hanif criticized the proposed development of two 13-story buildings along Prospect Avenue in Windsor Terrace. A quarter of the housing was set aside for affordable housing. Hanif, whose approval is necessary for the project to move forward, did not say whether she would ultimately give approval.", "Tede\n\nTede may refer to:", "Frank H. Smith\n\nFrank H.

Chris first appears in \"Friday the 13th Part III\" (1982) as a young woman visiting a family homestead with friends to overcome trauma. She is portrayed by Dana Kimmell. Writing duo Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson wrote her as the new protagonist of the series after the previous film's lead, Amy Steel, declined to return as Ginny. An uncredited Petru Popescu rewrote their script and spent the most time developing Chris\u2014giving her an in-depth background and a past connection to series villain Jason Voorhees.\nProducers of the film actively sought out Dana Kimmell upon seeing her in the slasher film \"Sweet Sixteen\" (1982). A casting agent contacted her and brought her in to Steve Miner, and all she had to do was scream in the audition. Kimmell performed all of her stunts in the film. The character's in-depth background and her characterization of dealing with her trauma have contributed to her being a topic in academic studies for shifting the focus of the villain in horror films to the protagonist. Additionally, Chris is the lead protagonist in the two novelizations based on the third film, Michael Avallone's 1982 and Simon Hawke's 1988 adaptations, each altering her ending.\nAppearances.\nChris appears in two of the twelve \"Friday the 13th\" films\u2014the third and films as a young woman traumatized from an encounter with Jason Voorhees. The books in the expanded universe further explore Chris' story.\nFilms.\nChris made her cinematic debut in \"Friday the 13th Part III\" on August 13, 1982. In this film, Chris is a young woman recovering from trauma who takes a group of friends and acquaintances to the Higgins Haven, her family homestead. Due to her trauma, she distances herself from the group and her boyfriend, Rick (Paul Kratka). In a monologue sequence, Chris reveals that two years prior, she was assaulted in the nearby woods by a severely disfigured man after a family fight and returned to her family's homestead in an attempt to face her trauma. Soon discovering that everyone is dead, Chris finds herself in a confrontation with her attacker, Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker). After fending him off, Chris finds herself cornered in her barn. Chris drops from a beam at the top of the barn and temporarily stuns Jason. After knocking him unconscious, she hangs him and hits him in the face with a hatchet. Due to already suffering from prior trauma, the events of the film leave her hysterical. Chris returns in an easter egg in \"\" (1984), as a young woman recovering in a hospital.\nLiterature.\nChris first appeared outside of film in the 1982 novelization of \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" by Michael Avallone; Avallone's novelization, based on the original screenplay, is notably different compared to the film version\u2014which had three different endings that change Chris's fate. Avallone's novel takes different narrative approaches to the character. Avallone features Chris written as a blonde twenty-year old and includes an ending that features Chris decapitating Jason with a sickle in the barn rather than striking him with a hatchet. The novel ends with Chris's original death scene written in as a nightmare sequence. In the nightmare, Chris enters the barn in an attempt to find the missing corpses to prove her sanity to authorities and is decapitated by Jason in the process. Additionally, Chris appears in Simon Hawke's 1988 novelization of the third film which follows the film more closely.\nDevelopment.\nConception.\nWriters Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson conceptualized her following Amy Steel's decision to turn down the offer of reprising Ginny, the heroine of the prior film.\nAn uncredited Petru Popescu was hired to do additional rewrites featuring the character. Popescu describes rewriting the Chris character to be the most creatively fulfilling as a writer as she had a past he could explore. He found Chris both easy and challenging to write due to this background, and that he spent the most time developing her. The biggest questions asked by the makers surrounding the character were the exact nature of her history with Jason. Early discussions involved a full-fledged rape backstory, although they deemed this too exploitative, and decided to keep her past with Jason ambiguous.\nThe role of Chris went to actress Dana Kimmell, although she wasn't who the writers of the script envisioned in the role. The television actress had recently led Jim Sotos' feature length slasher film \"Sweet Sixteen\" (1983) which caught the attention of Frank Mancuso Jr., the producer of \"Friday the 13th Part III\" (1982). He reached out to Kimmell, and she met with a casting director. He brought her to an audition, in which all she had to do was scream, with Mancuso Jr. and director Steve Miner. Due to a scheduling conflict with another project, Kimmell was initially unable to sign on to the film. However, the filmmakers postponed filmmaking until she was available. Kimmell describes the character as \"a young college girl who takes her friends up in the mountains.\" There wasn't a lot of discussion or preparation for her character until she arrived on set to begin shooting. Kimmell has expressed gratitude for the film, stating that \"it's by no means a cheap horror film,\" and described Chris as a \"good part.\"\nAlthough speculations surfaced that Kimmell pushed for various changes in the movie, Kimmell only recalls expressing discomfort to Mancuso, Jr. about dialogue referencing Chris having sex with her boyfriend. Kimmell states she got permission to alter the lines for this scene as she believed the \"Friday the 13th\" series to have a young audience and didn't want the film to be overtly sexual. Costar Tracie Savage states, \"Each person took care of themselves. Dana had no say over what was happening. She wouldn't have had that authority. The priority is to scare the hell out of people, and if they have an actress who was concerned about the art, they're going to say, \"Sorry, we'll find somebody else.\"\nKimmell wanted to perform her stunts as there was a lot of free time between takes; it motivated her for her scene work. Kimmell recollects obtaining bruises throughout the shoot from performing Chris's stunts\u2014such as the barn beam scene where she was 18 feet above the ground and had to fall. This sequence had to have several retakes. The original ending of Chris getting decapitated at the hands of Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) was scrapped due to the filmmakers finding this ending to be too grim. This ending would have marked the first film in the franchise to feature the protagonist dying.\nCharacterization.\nFilm critic Janet Maslin (\"The New York Times\") writes that Chris is the \"lone survivor\" and by the end of the film, she is left traumatized. Writer Jim Harper wrote that, unlike her peers, Chris is reluctant to engage in sexual activity\u2014because of her past alluding to sexual assault. When discussing the psychological aspects of Chris, scholar Wade Newhouse describes Chris as an exploration of the psychology of a victim\u2014unlike the prior films focus on the killers Pamela Voorhees and Jason. Newhouse describes her as being set apart from the other characters in the film, attributing it to Chris' self-awareness rather than a morality play. Newhouse highlights her monologue as showing her \"in a sense worth saving because her introspection marks her as unique in a world of otherwise generic teenagers.\"\nSimilarly, Brennan Thomas characterizes Chris as showing signs of PTSD, emphasizing her as the franchise's most physically and emotionally vulnerable character. Thomas further likens her vulnerability to a post-war Vietnam veteran due to her extensive trauma. Wickham Clayton credits Chris as the first protagonist of the \"Friday the 13th\" films to have an in-depth backstory explored. Clayton attributes her backstory and its connected flashback scene that alludes to the possibility of rape by Jason as allowing Chris to have a fully developed character arc that explains her mental breakdown at the end of the film. Clayton argues that the sufficient characterization provided to Chris allows the audience to have an emotional engagement with her wellbeing compared to the heroines of the prior installments.\nTim Dirks describes Chris's confrontation with Jason as a \"monumental battle of wits and stamina.\" Jack Pooley (\"WhatCulture\") describes the character as \"annoyingly hysterical\" but praises Chris for her resourcefulness during the film's finale. Joan Bunke (\"Des Moines Tribune\") describes Chris as \"dim\" for the character's decision of returning to the place that traumatized her.\nPopular culture.\nChris appears as an easter egg in the video game \"\" (2017) as a figurine players must collect in order to progress in the game mode. Writer Stacie Ponder included an illustration of Chris in her 2017 \"Friday the 13th\" death count book.", "Zoon (band)\n\nZoon is a Canadian shoegaze band from Hamilton, Ontario, whose core member is Anishinaabe musician Daniel Monkman. They are most noted for their 2020 album \"Bleached Wavves\", which was a shortlisted finalist for the 2021 Polaris Music Prize.\nOriginally from Selkirk, Manitoba and a member of the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation, Monkman moved to Hamilton after stints living in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Calgary, Alberta. They abandoned music for a number of years during which they struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, before getting sober with the help of the traditional Anishinaabe Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers.\nMonkman reestablished their musical career in Hamilton, initially using the band name Bloom before adopting the name Zoon from the Grandfathers' teaching of \"zoongide'ewin\" (bravery and courage). The band, whose music blends shoegaze rock with elements of traditional First Nations music in a style which Monkman refers to as \"moccasin-gaze\", features a varying lineup, with its current members being guitarist Daniel Wintermans, bassist Drew Rutt and drummer Andrew McLeod.\nSelected tracks from \"Bleached Wavves\" were released as an EP in 2019, before the full album was released in 2020 on Paper Bag Records as the band's full-length debut. Monkman has also collaborated with Adam Sturgeon of Status/Non-Status in OMBIIGIZI, who released their debut album \"Sewn Back Together\" in 2022.

It is probably a study, which was thought to be lost, for the painting \"Blue Horses\" (1911). The painting became known worldwide on the occasion of the Schwabing art discovery in November 2013. It was one of the first eleven works to be shown at a press conference by the Augsburg public prosecutor. The small-format work measures \nDescription.\nThe three horses in the study, painted in a sideways position or from behind, are brown-blue in colour. They stand with their heads bowed to the left, in front of a mountainous landscape, which is vaulted by a sky with white clouds. The outlines of the horses reflect the mountains. The two knotless, white tree trunks in the foreground and background, which look like a diagonal, are striking. The front trunk is touched by the horse in the foreground. The watercolour was made on brown paper, and its edges appear irregular. It is signed on the left edge of the picture without specifying the year.\nVariation.\nThe famous Marc painting from the same year, \"Blue Horses\" created after this study in oil on canvas, has the dimensions and shows the same motif, with only the colours changed significantly. The horse's bodies are held in a strong blue, the landscape and sky have red and purple tones that do not correspond to reality. The paintings \"Blue Horse I\" and \"Blue Horse II\" were also created in 1911. In all of the horse pictures of this time, Marc turns blue from an \u201cappearance colour\u201d to an \u201cessential colour\u201d. The colour blue stood for the male principle in his own colour theory. With the animal image he found a symbol for a \u201cspiritualization of the world\u201d. The blue horses push like the blue flower searching out for deliverance from earthly weight and material bondage. In 1913 he created the painting \"The Tower of Blue Horses\", again with blue horses as a motif, whose whereabouts have been unknown since 1945.\nProvenance.\nOn 5 November 2013, a televised press conference by art historian Meike Hoffmann, on the Schwabing Art Find (Gurlitt Collection), presented the current painting alongside Max Liebermann's work \"Two Riders on the Beach\", and nine other paintings. Like the other works shown, it came from the collection of the art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, which was inherited by his son Cornelius Gurlitt. The Augsburg public prosecutor's office under the direction of Reinhard Nemetz confiscated its collection in February 2012. The case was made known to the public in a report on November 3, 2013.\nThe former owner of the watercolour until 1937 was the Moritzburg Art and Industry Museum in Halle, and it had been acquired by its director Max Sauerlandt in 1914. A former employee of the museum recognized the coloured painting, which had previously only been documented in black and white. The Expressionist work was considered \"degenerate\" by the Nazi regimen, removed and confiscated from the museum, and came afterwards into the possession of Hildebrand Gurlitt. The museum in Moritzburg aims to return it.", "Good Things (Dan + Shay album)\n\nGood Things is the fourth studio album by American country pop duo Dan + Shay.

The purpose of a citation is to allow the reader to understand the source of the legislative principle being cited, and to find the law in question. It is a type of legal citation, namely a \"reference to a legal precedent or authority, such as a case, statute, or treatise, that either substantiates or contradicts a given position\".\nThe Canadian citation system covers the primary laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada and the provincial and territorial legislatures. The citation system also applies to secondary legislation, such as regulations. The format for citations is generally similar across Canada, but there are some differences in particular cases.\nCanadian statutes were originally published solely in book form, so statute citation methods have traditionally been based on the physical book in which the statutory provision can be found. With the expansion of internet publishing, statutes are now published mainly online, and in some jurisdictions, the online publication is official. However, the statute citation methods still tend to be based on the model of a physical book, in some cases with additional provisions to show the electronic source of a statute.\nCitation Guides.\nThe primary guide to statute citation in Canada is the \"Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation\", commonly called the \"McGill Guide\". The Guide is produced by the McGill Law Journal of the McGill University Faculty of Law in Montreal in a fully bilingual format. It has been adopted by a number of Canadian law journals and courts as the standard guide.\nHowever, the \"McGill Guide\" is not the only statute citation system. For example, the courts of Saskatchewan have adopted their own uniform guide to citation, to be used for all documents filed in the Saskatchewan courts. Although similar to the rules set out in the \"McGill Guide\", it differs in points of detail. Law schools may also publish guides to citation, such as the online guide prepared by Queen's University Library, based on the \"McGill Guide\". Other institutions, such as law journals, may have their own house style.\nConstitutional enactments.\nThe Constitution of Canada is made up of over thirty different enactments, from various sources. There is no uniform way to cite them. The two enactments which are most frequently cited are the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" and the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\". They are generally cited as follows:\nAnother option is to cite to reproductions of the constitutional enactments in Appendix II of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1985. By this approach, the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" is cited as:\nGiven the length of this citation, the section number being cited should follow immediately the title of the enactment, rather than after the RSC reference. Another difficulty is that not all of the constitutional enactments are contained in Appendix II.\nLegislative practice.\nParliament and most provincial legislatures in Canada use a mixture of revised statutes and annual statutes, so the citation will depend on the source of the statute. In these systems, the citation is either to the revised statutes, or to the annual volume. Amending statutes are cited to the annual volume where the statute was enacted.\nThere are two provinces which do not follow this system: Quebec and Manitoba. Instead, both of these provinces use an ongoing consolidation, composed of existing statutes. As new principal statutes are enacted, they are added to the ongoing revision, with citations to the ongoing consolidation. New statutes or amending statutes continue to be cited to the annual volume until incorporated into the ongoing consolidation.\nStatutes: basic elements.\nThe basic elements for a statute citation will generally be similar across Canada, although there are some variations amongst jurisdictions. The statute citation system for each jurisdiction will reflect these differences in legislative practices.\nStatute citations will normally contain the following elements:\nTitles.\nAll statutes have a long title, listed at the head of the statute. Most jurisdictions also give a short title for statutes, either as the first section of the statute, or as the header of the subsequent pages of the statute in the hard copies. For example, the long title of the \"Criminal Code\" is \"An Act respecting the Criminal Law\". The short title is given in the first section: \"This Act may be cited as the \"Criminal Code\".\" In some cases, the year is included in the short title of a statute. In that case, it is separated from the words of the short title by a comma. Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, include \"The\" in the short title of their statutes.\nThe short title and the long title of a statute or regulation are italicised. The title is followed by a comma.\nVolume and jurisdiction.\nThe volume and jurisdiction together identify the source of the statute. When the volume is in a statute revision, the source is given as \"Revised Statutes\" coupled with the jurisdiction. For example, the revised statutes of Canada or New Brunswick will be cited as \"Revised Statutes of Canada\" or \"Revised Statutes of New Brunswick\". \"Revised Statutes\" is abbreviated as \"RS\" along with the abbreviation for the jurisdiction, so \"Revised Statutes of Canada\" is abbreviated as \"RSC\" and \"Revised Statutes of New Brunswick\" is abbreviated as \"RSNB\". The abbreviation is then followed by the year the revision was produced.\nWhen the statute is found in one of the annual statute volumes rather than a statute revision, the reference is simply to the statutes of that jurisdiction. For example, an annual volume of the federal statutes is cited as \"Statutes of Canada\", abbreviated \"SC\". The same pattern is used for a citation to a provincial or territorial statute volume. A Prince Edward Island statute volume would be cited as \"Statutes of Prince Edward Island\", or \"SPEI\".\nThe two ongoing provincial revisions, Quebec and Manitoba, are cited to the continuing consolidations: \"Continuing Consolidation of the Statutes of Manitoba\" (\"CCSM\") and \"Consolidation of Quebec Laws and Regulations\" (\"CQLR\"). References to annual statutes of these two provinces are cited in the same way as other jurisdictions: \"Statutes of Manitoba\" (\"SM\") and \"Statutes of Quebec\" (\"SQ\"), followed by the year.\nThere is no comma after the abbreviation of volume and jurisdiction.\nYear.\nWhen the statute is found in a statute revision, the date is the year of the statute revision, not the date when the statute was originally enacted. For example, the current Revised Statute of Canada were finalised in 1985, so the citation is \"RSC 1985\". The current Revised Statutes of Ontario were finalised in 1990, and are therefore cited as \"RS0 1990\".\nNo date is used for the continuing consolidations of Quebec and Manitoba.\nFor annual volumes, the date is the that of the volume. For example, the volume of annual statutes of Canada for 2020 is cited as \"SC 2020\", while the volume of annual statutes for the Northwest Territories in 2021 is cited as \"SNWT 2021\". Some of the older volumes would be based on a parliamentary session, rather than the year of enactment, so the date could span two or more calendar years. For example, Parliament was continuously in session from 1974 to 1976, so the annual statute for that period is actually cited as \"SC 1974-75-76\".\nIn the case of a long session, there can be more than one volume of statutes in the annual statutes. The SC 1974-75-76 is actually three volumes. When the legislature enacts a large number of acts, or lengthy acts, that can also mean that the annual statutes are spread over more than one volume. However, the citation is always to the specific chapter number of the statute in question, without any reference to the volume number in the annual statutes.\nThe former practice was to use the regnal year of the monarch as the date for the annual statute volumes. That practice is no longer followed for statutes enacted after Confederation in 1867.\nThere is a comma after the year.\nChapter number.\nWithin the annual statutes, each statute is assigned a chapter number. \"Chapter\" is abbreviated as \"c.\", followed by the chapter number. As mentioned above, in multi-volume revised statutes or annual statutes, there is no need to refer to the volume number, as the chapter number is a precise reference.\nThe practice in older statute volumes was to use simple numeric chapter numbers, but the newer practice is to use alpha-numeric chapter numbers for principal acts, based on the title of the statute, which facilitates sorting by title. Alphanumeric chapter numbers are based on the initial letter of the first word in the title, followed by a hyphen, and then the number of that statute within that alphabetical location. For example, the \"Criminal Code\" is the 46th statute in the Revised Statutes of Canada under \"C\", so its chapter number is \"C-46\". Whilst most provinces follow the federal model, Ontario uses a decimal in place of a hyphen. Some jurisdictions, such as Nova Scotia, continue to use simple numeric chapter numbers in their revised statutes\nAlphanumeric chapter numbers are used for principal acts. Acts amending principal acts are normally simply given a numeric chapter number in the annual statute volume.\nThere is a comma after the chapter number.\nSection numbers.\nThe general practice is to cite to the specific section of an act which is in issue, or to a range of specific sections. Although statutes may be sub-divided into parts or titles, the citation normally gives a pinpoint cite to the section number. Parts or titles can be cited when the purpose is to refer to an entire part of the statute.\n\"Section\" is always abbreviated to \"s.\" (for one section) or \"ss.\" (for more than one section). The symbols \"\u00a7\" and \"\u00b6\" are not used for statute citations.\nExamples of citations.\nUsing these components, statutes are cited as follows:\nAbbreviations.\nReferences to the parts of statutes are abbreviated as follows:\nThe jurisdictions are abbreviated as follows:\nPeriods.\nThe \"McGill Guide\" recommends that no periods be used for abbreviations, such as \"c\" for \"chapter\" and \"s\" for \"section\". However, not all guides follow that approach. For example, the Saskatchewan Courts guide provides that periods can be used for abbreviations in some instances, but not others.\nAdditional comments.\nBilingual legislation.\nAll federal statutes and the statutes of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut are bilingual, French and English. Some Saskatchewan statutes are also bilingual.\nThe citation system is the same for English and French statutes, but the abbreviations used for citations in French are different than in English. The \"McGill Guide\", which is itself fully bilingual, should be consulted for the French citation styles.\nBill numbers.\nWhen a draft law is introduced in Parliament or a legislative assembly, it is referred to as a \"Bill\", and is given a bill number. In the federal Parliament, bills introduced in the House of Commons are designated \"C-\", followed by the number, whilst bills introduced in the Senate are designated \"S-\", followed by the number. Bills introduced in the unicameral provincial legislative assemblies are simply given numbers.\nThe bill numbering system restarts on a regular basis. In the federal Parliament and some provincial legislative assemblies, the bill numbering restarts at the beginning of a new session. In some legislative assemblies, the bill numbering restarts with a new assembly after a general election, and runs until the dissolution of the assembly and the next general election. Since the numbering systems regularly restart from 1, bill numbers are not unique to a particular statute. They are therefore not permanent citations. As well, once enacted a bill is no longer a bill, but an Act of the legislature.\nFor these reasons, bill numbers are not used once a bill is enacted as a statute. The statute citation system is used instead, which gives the statute a permanent and unique citation in the annual statute volume where it is published.\nRegulations.\nRegulations follow similar patterns, but there is much greater variation between different jurisdictions. All jurisdictions have a system of consolidating regulations, but may also publish regulations separately, usually in the Gazette for that jurisdiction.\nElectronic sources.\nAll jurisdictions now make their statutes available on-line, through their own government web-pages, and through CanLII. In some jurisdictions, the electronic source is equally official with the published statute books, but in other jurisdictions the statute books are the sole official source. However, even when citing to electronic sources, the same principles of citation apply, with the addition of links to the electronic source.", "Lying (Dan + Shay song)\n\n\"Lying\" is a song by American country pop duo Dan + Shay.

The painting depicts two of Haiti\u2019s founding revolutionaries, mixed-race general Alexandre P\u00e9tion and Black general Jean-Jacques Dessalines at a decisive moment in the Haitian Revolution. The two generals are seen forming an alliance in 1802 to oust French forces from the island. The men are seen looking up to a God-like figure above them as chaos ensues in the background.\nLethi\u00e8re made this painting to celebrate the birth of the nation of Haiti and acknowledge his racial identity as a mixed-race French man of Caribbean descent. Lethi\u00e8re gave the painting to the Haitian government in 1823, recognizing the country's fight for independence. The painting was found in the ruins of the presidential palace in the Haitian capital following the 2010 Haiti earthquake and was restored by the Louvre. Currently, it is held by the Mus\u00e9e du Panth\u00e9on National Ha\u00eftien in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\nContext.\nLethi\u00e8re was born in Guadeloupe to Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Pepeye, a Black slave, and Pierre Guillon, a white French planter. A member of the elite class of people of color living in France, Lethi\u00e8re was a well respected and successful painter. However, Lethi\u00e8re had been confronted with the reality of his Creole past as a mixed-race man living in France when the right to have Guillon included in his name was legally contested in 1819 by a man who said Lethi\u00e8re was born out of adultery, making him an illegitimate son of Guillon. Lethi\u00e8re created this painting towards the end of his life to align himself with and celebrate the Black and mulatto revolutionaries in Haiti who bravely came together to fight against French forces.\nComposition and analysis.\nThe painting depicts two Haitian revolutionary leaders, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a formerly enslaved man, and Alexandre P\u00e9tion, a mixed-race officer, holding onto each other as they look up to a God-like figure in the sky. This gesture symbolizes solidarity and cooperation between different racial groups in the fight for Haiti\u2019s independence. The two men are standing on top of chains to symbolize the ending of slavery in Haiti, which was, according to the painting, accomplished due to the bravery of P\u00e8tion, Dessalines, and the soldiers in the background.\nThough this painting represents the freedom of people of color due to their own resilience, Lethi\u00e8re still positions them under the authority of a \"white father\". Lethi\u00e8re made this painting as a gift to the Haitians as a recognition of all they went through at the hands of white men, but some scholars argue that the large white, God-like figure sends a message that a white, patriarchal figure still presides over the new nation. This divine figure stands as a reminder that Haitian independence, despite its success, remains incomplete without acknowledgment from France, the \"white father\" figure.\nOther scholars say Lethi\u00e8re included the divine figure above the men with their eyes pointed towards heaven because Toussaint L'Ouverture, the most prominent leader in the Haitian Revolution, proclaimed The Haitian Constitution of 1801, the island's first constitution. The constitution banned slavery and was attributed by L'Ouverture to the protection of a divine figure in a speech where he stated that Haitians should thank God for the gift of freedom. This may be why Lethi\u00e8re depicts the men listening to, and repeating, an oath from the God figure, which appears to be inscribed on the stela between them. From what is visible, the inscription reads, \"Freedom, Religion, Laws, Constitution\", \"Live free or die\", and \"Strength through unity\".\nAdditionally, for the first time in his professional career, Lethi\u00e8re added text following his signature, perhaps as a form of protest and as an acknowledgment of his identity, saying: \"Born in Guadeloupe. Year 1760.\"\nLocation history.\nIn contrast with Lethi\u00e8re's previous paintings, which were meant for a French audience, \"The Oath of the Ancestors\" was specifically made for the people of Haiti. Delivered secretly by Lethi\u00e8re's son to the President of Haiti, Jean-Pierre Boyer, the painting acts as a personal and political gesture of solidarity with Haiti's independence.\nHowever, the heroism with which Lethi\u00e8re depicted Dessalines did not align with popular opinion in Haiti. The people of Haiti, including President Boyer, knew Dessalines as a ruthless, genocidal leader. Boyer did not want to hang a \"work that recognized Dessalines as an ancestor and founder of the nation equal to P\u00e9tion\" in a government building, so he hung it in the Port-au-Prince Cathedral.\nThe painting was moved from the cathedral to the Palais de l'Ind\u00e9pendance, a museum dedicated to the nation's history, in 1904.\nIn 1918, Bishop Jean-Marie Jan reclaimed the painting for a newly constructed cathedral in Port-au-Prince, where it was placed behind the main altar. After 73 years in a hot and humid environment, the painting was taken by G\u00e8rard-Florent Laballe and Genevi\u00e8ve Capy to be restored in France. The painting was successfully restored in 1995 and was exhibited in France and Guadeloupe before returning to the Presidential Palace in Haiti in 1998.\nIn 2010, an 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the island of Haiti, leaving Lethi\u00e8re's painting in extremely poor condition, but not destroyed; it was pieced back together with tape. The painting was sent to the Louvre to be restored and has since been returned to Haiti. The painting currently is held in the Mus\u00e9e du Panth\u00e9on National Ha\u00eftien in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\nInfluences.\nJacques-Louis David.\nThere are many parallels between Lethi\u00e8re's painting and Jacques-Louis David's unfinished work \"Oath of the Tennis Court\", which depicts a pivotal moment in the French Revolution. Both paintings represent a turbulent point in their respective countries' histories and evoke a sense of brotherhood as men rise up to fight the oppressive powers of their governments. Additionally, the drapery flowing in the wind in David's work parallels the wind blowing through Dessalines's cape.\nAdditionally, in David's \"Oath of the Horatii\", the brothers unite by responding to the patriarch who commands them in a manner that loosely parallels the interaction between men and the God figure in Lethi\u00e9re's work.", "Luciana G\u00f3mez (footballer, born 2000)\n\nLuciana Daniela G\u00f3mez Montans (born 28 July 2000) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Brazilian S\u00e9rie A1 side Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro and the Uruguay women's national team.

The COVID-19 Vaccination Plan Task Force was formalised on 23 November 2020. It was led by Francisco Ramos, former Undersecretary of State and Health, and composed of military personnel, technicians from the Shared Services of the Ministry of Health (SPMS), the General Directorate of Health and Infarmed. In 30 days, on 18 December, the task force presented the plan, which divided the vaccination into three phases, according to the priority of the people to be vaccinated.\nApproval of vaccines within the European Union is done by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the first COVID-19 vaccine, Tozinameran from Pfizer/BioNTech, was approved on 21 December 2020. In concert with other EU countries, Portugal began vaccination on 27 December, followed by vaccination of healthcare professionals directly in contact with COVID patients. The first Portuguese to be vaccinated was Ant\u00f3nio Sarmento, director of the infectious diseases department at the Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o.\nPortugal stands out internationally as one of the countries with the highest percentage of vaccinated population: with data as of 11 October 2021 88% of the country's total population has received the first dose.

The building was constructed between 1811 and 1814 as St George's Church and converted to its current purpose as a records office between 1964 and 1970.\nThe church's site in the centre of the western side of Charlotte Square had been designated for a church as part of James Craig's initial plan for the New Town. The building was designed by Robert Reid after a similar but more intricate plan by Robert Adam, who designed the square's surrounding terraces. Construction began in 1811 and, though initially projected to cost \u00a318,000, the total cost came to \u00a333,000. The facade centres on an Ionic portico, above which rises a substantial green copper dome on a tall, peristyle drum. The dome, topped by a gilt cupola and cross, is a prominent feature of the Edinburgh skyline and terminates the view west along George Street. The interior of the church was gutted during its conversion as a records office. It had been noted for its tall pulpit by William Trotter.\nSt George's Church opened in 1814 to serve as the Church of Scotland parish church for the western half of the New Town. In its early years, it was notable for the ministries of two leading evangelicals: Andrew Mitchell Thomson and Robert Smith Candlish. The latter led out a significant portion of the congregation during the Disruption of 1843. Thomson also established a strong musical tradition at St George's: this continued with prominent choirmasters and organists, including Alexander Mackenzie. By the early 1960s, severe structural damage in the church building had become apparent and, in 1964, the congregation united with that of St Andrew's on George Street to form St Andrew's and St George's. Between 1964 and 1970, Robert Saddler converted the building for use as a public records office. A restoration of the building was completed in 2021.\nHistory.\nSt George's Church.\nIn 1809, Parliament resolved that when the population of the western part of the New Town reached 5,000, the civic authorities should build a new Church of Scotland church to serve the area's inhabitants. The eastern part of the New Town was already served by St Andrew's Church yet, as the New Town had expanded, demand for sittings had grown so great that some Presbyterian worshippers had resorted to attending St George's Episcopal Chapel on York Place.\nRobert Adam had designed a church as the centrepiece of the western side of the square; The funds raised by renting pews in advance had proven insufficient, however. The city council therefore charged Robert Reid to create a new design. Reid had offered a verbal estimate of \u00a318,000 for the costs of construction.\nThe foundation stone was laid on 14 May 1811 by Lord Provost William Calder. Construction took three years and the first service took place on Sunday, 5 June 1814 during celebrations for the conclusion of the War of the Sixth Coalition. Henry Moncreiff-Wellwood, minister of St Cuthbert's, preached the first sermon. By completion, the cost of the project had nearly doubled to \u00a333,000. Prior to opening, the charge had been erected as a parish \"quoad sacra\" by the presbytery with a parish area allotted from portions of St Andrew's and St Cuthbert's. As the charge was supported by the city council, St George's was a burgh church and the stipend of its minister was supported by diverting money from the second charge of the New North Church.\nThe church's first minister was Andrew Mitchell Thomson: the informal leader of the Church of Scotland's evangelical faction and a keen social reformer. When Thomson died in 1831, Thomas Chalmers, his effective successor as the leading evangelical, preached his funeral sermon in St George's. Assisted from 1823 by choirmaster R.A. Smith, Thomson also established St George's strong musical tradition, even holding choir practices at his house. Smith's most notable successor was Alexander Mackenzie: who served as choirmaster and organist from 1870 to 1881.\nInitially, St George's supported the Sunday school work of St Andrew's using the kitchen of the Assembly Rooms on George Street. Soon, St George's established its own schools in Rose Street and William Street before a mission was established on Young Street in 1835. In 1837, this congregation became a parish \"quoad sacra\" as St Luke's. At the Disruption of 1843, the congregation joined the Free Church.\nSt George's minister from 1834, Robert Smith Candlish, was second only to Chalmers as a leading evangelical; he was also an enthusiastic promoter of Sabbatarianism. At the Disruption of 1843, Candlish led out much of his congregation to form Free St George's. During Candlish's ministry, the congregation counted several Lords of Session, including James Wellwood Moncreiff and his son, James Moncreiff, 1st Baron Moncreiff; David Cathcart, Lord Alloway; James Ivory, Lord Ivory; Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn; John Fullerton, Lord Fullerton; Alexander Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank; and Thomas Maitland, Lord Dundrennan. Three Lord Provosts \u2013 William Trotter of Ballindean, Kincaid Mackenzie, and John Learmonth \u2013 were also seat-holders as were Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster and the scholars James Pillans and John Shank More.\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, structural issues began to plague the building and a portal frame was erected to support the dome. The congregation launched an appeal for \u00a340,000 in January 1960. Despite the appeal's success, the extent of dry rot in the building soon became apparent and the congregation entered into negotiations for union with St Andrew's. The charges were linked with a single minister in June 1962 and formal union was completed on 7 June 1964. At the time of its closure, the church maintained halls and a church officer's house at Randolph Place. The manse was at 17 Wester Coates Crescent, having been at 3 Melville Crescent before 1946.\nThe following ministers served St George's:\n\u2020 \"died in office\"\nWest Register House.\nThe building was purchased by Scottish Records Office and converted to a public record office under Robert Saddler of the Ministry of Public Building and Works. This involved the gutting of the interior to install five storeys and a two-storey entrance hall. During conversion, the West Register House was designated a Category A listed building in 1966.\nRestoration work on the building, supported by Edinburgh World Heritage was completed in 2021. This included covering the exterior in scaffolding to restore stonework and to regild the cross at the top of the building. During the restoration, homelessness charities, including Shelter, criticised plans to install railings to deter rough sleepers.\nArchitecture.\nSetting.\nA.J. Youngson called St George's dome \"one of the most notable features of the Edinburgh skyline\". The church's dome is prominent in the western half of the first New Town and terminates the view along George Street. St George's occupies a site designated for a church in James Craig's initial plan for the New Town.\nBoth George Hay and the Buildings of Scotland guide to Edinburgh note that while the building is out of proportion to its surrounding terraces, it forms an effective visual terminus to the view along George Street. Ian Gordon Lindsay and William Forbes Gray also note the church's lack of proportion to Adam\u2019s surrounding buildings. Gray surmises that Reid designed the church relative to the overall size of the square rather than to its neighbouring terraces.\nRobert Adam's plan.\nIn his plan for Charlotte Square, Robert Adam designed a church for this site. Modelled after St Paul's Cathedral, it was to have an advanced portico with a pediment supported on coupled columns. Pavilions with pilasters on the corners would have flanked this arrangement while supporting small domes on peristyle drums. The central dome would have been similar, albeit shallower and with four pedimented faces on the drum. By the time of St George's construction, concerns over cost and the waning popularity of the Adam style meant a new design was sought from Robert Reid.\nExterior.\nThe facade of the building, facing onto Charlotte Square, centres on a balustraded portico supported by four Ionic columns in antis and accessed a flight of shallow steps. Within the portico, two rectangular entrances flank an arched entrance. All are filled in with smoked glass, which replaced wooden doors at the time of the building's secularisation.\nTwo pavilions flank the portico. Each pavilion stands on a base course and contains a rectangular window and oculus within a recessed arch; above this, an empty frieze panel sits between an impost course and the cornice, which is continuous with the portico. The pavilions are topped by panelled attic storeys in line with the balustrade of the portico. Reid's drawings show plans to include clocks within the faces of the attic storeys and to crown the pavilions with statues of female figures. These were never executed. The rear facade of the building, which faces onto Randolph Place, centres on a rear of attenuated pavilions flanking a Diocletian window above a Venetian window. David Bryce drew up plans to add towers to the pavilions. This too was never carried out.\nThe building's prominent green copper dome and gilded cupola are supported by a two-stage drum. The bottom part of the drum is peristyled with every fourth bay blocked in by a niche. The shorter upper section is pierced with oculi. The drum and dome rise from a stout square base over the former vestibule at the front of the building.\nThe building's plan is 112\u00a0ft (34m) in width and length while its total height is 160\u00a0ft (49m). The exterior is constructed of Craigleith sandstone.\nInterior.\nPrior to conversion, the sanctuary was shaped as a Greek cross. George Hay identifies this as one of only two such plans in Scottish churches of this period: the other is at Carnock in Fife. At the intersection of the cross\u2019 limbs, piers in each corner spanned by coffered segmental arches supported a shallow, coffered dome centring on a circular light. Illumination was also provided by three-light windows in the north, south, and east arms. These same arms housed galleries while the west arm was occupied by the focal point of the pulpit, communion table, and pipe organ.\nThe church was able to accommodate 1,600 worshippers, the interior was, prior to conversion, relatively plain though distinguished by a large pulpit in Spanish mahogany by William Trotter. This stood at including its canopy, which was removed some time before 1940. The Royal Commission on the Ancient Monuments of Scotland's survey in 1951 found most of the furnishings were then modern while the doors to sanctuary were likely original. The surround of the central door to the sanctuary was fashioned as a memorial after the First World War. These doors connected the sanctuary to a spacious vestibule with gallery stairs. The organ was a two-manual Father Willis installed in 1882 and upgraded to three manuals by the same firm in 1897 and again enlarged by them in 1932. The organ was removed in 1962 and parts of it were reused at St Mary &amp; St Giles Church, Stony Stratford.\nThe current interior, dating from Robert Saddler's conversion of the building between 1964 and 1970, consists of five storeys. These are accessed via a two-storey entrance hall with mezzanine floor.\nCriticism.\nEarly critics, including \"The Scots Magazine\", drew negative comparisons between Reid's design and Adam's, noting that the latter could have been built for the ultimate cost of Reid's. Victorian critics included John Ruskin, who called it \"a most costly and most ugly building\", and James Grant, who described the building as \"heavy in appearance, meagre in detail, and hideous in conception\".\nLater writers were more measured. George Hay hailed the facade as a \"fine composition\" while noting the dome's lack of relation to the rest of the building. He also criticised the interior as \"rather an anti-climax\". William Forbes Gray described the building as \"an impressive reminder that we were once in earnest about churchgoing\". A.J. Youngson found harsher criticisms of the building unjust while also concluding \"it is certainly a pity the Adam design was not used\".", "COVID-19 vaccination in Iran\n\nIran fully vaccinated almost 50 percent of the population by November 5th 2021, and permanently halted vaccine shot import. General population were to take the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine.\nFrom December 2021 electronic vaccine certificate were mandatory for work, mandatory service in Iranian Armed Forces, universities, and schools.\nVaccination began late in Iran because Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, banned the import and use of American and British vaccines. This decision stopped the import and use of Pfizer vaccines and during that period many Iranians died due to covid. Khamenei was heavily criticised for this. Research has stated that if vaccination was performed earlier, around 50\u201375 thousand fewer people would have died from COVID-19. \nIran broke its record of weekly vaccinations by opening 24-hour vaccination centres. Importing vaccine accelerated by changing the administration, but there is no evidence to demonstrate how much this rapidity of imports goes back to the mass production of vaccines, worldwide.", "Rayhan Asat\n\nRayhan Asat is a Uyghur lawyer and human rights advocate. Since 2020, she has led a public campaign for the release of her brother, Ekpar Asat, who has been held in the Xinjiang internment camp system since 2016, and on behalf of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in China. In 2021, she joined the Strategic Litigation Project at the Atlantic Council as a Nonresident Senior Fellow and became a Yale World Fellow. Asat is also a Senior Fellow at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and President of the American Turkic International Lawyers Association.\nBiography.\nAsat was born in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, the capital of Xinjiang. Her mother was a chemistry professor and her father worked in the water resources administration.\nIn 2016, while she was attending the LL.M. program at Harvard Law School, she was able to meet with her younger brother Ekpar Asat, who was visiting the United States as a participant in the International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP), run by the US State Department. After her brother returned to China, her parents cancelled their planned trip to the United States for her upcoming graduation, and then she learned her brother had been detained in the Xinjiang internment camp system.\nIn January 2020, she learned her brother was sentenced to 15 years of incarceration for \"inciting ethnic hatred and ethnic discrimination,\" after the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. notified US Senator Chris Coons in response to a letter sent by Coons and a group of lawmakers to Ambassador Cui Tiankai. By 2021, she learned her brother had been moved from the camps in 2019 and into solitary confinement. In early 2021, she participated in a supervised video call with her brother.\nAfter completing her LL.M., Asat worked in the Anti-Corruption and Internal Investigations department of the law firm Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed LLP, and became a Senior Fellow at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. In 2021, she joined the Strategic Litigation Project at the Atlantic Council as a Nonresident Senior Fellow, with her work focused on the human rights abuses of her brother and Uyghurs generally in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In 2021, she also became a Yale World Fellow.\nAdvocacy.\nDespite fear of retaliation against her family in Xinjiang, Asat began her public campaign of advocacy on behalf of her brother during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by speaking publicly at Harvard in March 2020 about her brother and the human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region. In June 2020, Harvard alumni attorneys wrote letters to the governments of the United States and China in support of his unconditional release, and Asat called on then-president Donald Trump to speak publicly on behalf of her brother.\nIn July 2020, sanctions described by \"The New York Times\" as appearing \"largely symbolic\" were imposed by the Trump administration on multiple officials from China in response to human rights abuses in Xinjiang, but according to Asat, the decision to impose sanctions \"sends a clear message to the perpetrators that they cannot continue to commit the crime of all crimes with impunity, to victims like my brother Ekpar Asat that they are not forgotten, and to the bystander countries to follow suit.\" In July 2020, Asat testified before the Parliament of Canada, advocating for the recognition of genocide happening in China and calling for sanctions. She also co-authored an article in \"Foreign Policy\" that described violations of the Genocide Convention against the Uighur community by the Chinese government.\nIn September 2020, she spoke with \"The Hill\" about her brother, and about how sterilization and family separation by the Chinese government \"has risen to the level of genocide,\" and joined protests against the Disney film \"Mulan\" due to reports of human rights abuses by the Chinese government against Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. In November 2020, while Asat spoke to students at Brandeis University during an online forum about Xinjiang, her screen was vandalized, after the university had received letters seeking the cancellation of the panel discussion. She has also used the Clubhouse app to raise awareness about her brother and the internment camps, including when the app was available in China, which allowed her to speak to Han Chinese before the app was banned.\nIn January 2021, Harvard student groups across multiple campuses organized an open letter to the US government and international community on behalf of Ekpar Asat and against the human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government confirmed the fifteen-year prison sentence of Ekpar Asat to \"ABC News\" in January 2021, without details related to the charges or his location. In February 2021, in her role as president of the American Turkic Lawyers Association, Asat wrote an opinion article in \"NBC News\" calling for the Biden administration to take further action, and advocating for the passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act by the US Congress. Asat continued to lobby for the Biden administration to take action on behalf of her brother, and was one of the 50 authors of a March 2021 report by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy that according to \"CNN\", \"claims that China's alleged actions in the Xinjiang region have violated every single provision in the United Nations' Genocide Convention.\"\nOn March 30, 2021, Asat attended an online Passover Seder hosted by Jewish World Watch for Uighurs, with the traditional seat left empty at the table in honor of the more than million people imprisoned or disappeared by China in the Xinjiang region. By then, both the Trump administration and the Biden administration had used the term genocide to describe the abuses perpetrated against Uighurs in Xinjiang, and legislation continued to be developed in the US Congress to better protect refugees and to ban the import of goods made in forced labor camps. In May 2021, Asat testified at a congressional hearing that debated a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\nIn June 2021, Asat spoke at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy about her brother, Uyghurs, and other ethnic minorities in China, as well as the internment camps and forced labor, and the complicity of the international community. On June 16, 2021, \"The Wall Street Journal\" published her commentary advocating for the 2022 Olympics to be relocated. In November 2021, Asat spoke at the Global Progressive Forum on human rights abuses and how to affect change in defense of democracy. At the invitation of President Joe Biden, Asat delivered remarks at the Summit for Democracy in December 2021.", "Primulina gemella\n\nPrimulina gemella is a plant in the family Gesneriaceae, native to Vietnam.

He also played one season for the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League (USFL). He played college football at Duke.\nEarly life and education.\nCarl McGee was born on July 15, 1956, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended Woodward High School there before playing college football at Duke. After leading his team to the championship, he was named by \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" as the high school football player of the year in 1974. He became a starter as soon as he entered the school, becoming one of the top defensive players almost instantly. He made 60 tackles by just week 5. Playing the second half of week 1, McGee made 11 tackles, against the defending champion Southern California. He scored his first career touchdown in his fifth career game, on a 68-yard return against Army. \"That was my first touchdown ever. I really didn't think I would go all the way with the interception but when I got to the end zone I was pretty excited,\" said McGee. Until a shipment of jerseys came, McGee would wear a different number each week, wearing 96, 58, 68, and 36 in his first few games. He recorded 130 tackles and one interception during the following season, being named All-ACC for the second straight year. By the end of his junior year he had compiled 377 tackles. In 1978, McGee said that he senior year goal was to \"go out and have a little bit of fun.\"\nProfessional career.\nMcGee was selected by the Cleveland Browns as the 234th pick of the 1979 NFL draft. A 9th round selection, McGee was released at roster cuts by the Browns. He was then acquired off waivers by the San Francisco 49ers, but released shortly afterwards. In January 1980, he was signed by the San Diego Chargers. He was given number 58 with the Chargers, the number he had worn in week one of his freshman season. He spent the beginning of the season on the practice squad, before being promoted to the active roster in early November. He played his first career game in a 13\u201320 loss against the Denver Broncos. He would play in five other games, missing just week 12. He also appeared in their two playoff games, ending when they lost 27\u201334 in the conference championship. He was released the next season, and did not sign with another team until with the Houston Oilers a year later. He was released at roster cuts again, this time ending his National Football League (NFL) career. On February 24, 1983, he signed a contract with the Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League (USFL). He was released and then signed by the Birmingham Stallions. He spent a few games on their roster, and played in a couple games. It would be the last team of his professional career.", "Ichneutica falsidica\n\nIchneutica falsidica is a moth of the family Noctuidae. This species is endemic to New Zealand and is widespread in the South Island but can only be found in the Tararua Range and Mount Taranaki in the North Island. This species is similar looking to \"I. panda\" but \"I. falsidica\" has dark dashes on their hind-wings. This species can be found open high country and has been seen flying during the day in sunny warm weather. At night adults are attracted to light. The life history of this species is unknown as are the host species of the larvae.\nTaxonomy.\n\"I. falsidica\" was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1911 using a female specimen collected at Mt Arthur and named \"Hyssia falsidica\". The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1913 George Hampson also described the same species, using specimens including the lectotype male that was collected in the Tararua Range, and named it \"Hyssia hamiltoni\". In his 1988 catalogue, J. S. Dugale stated that this species was placed within the \"Aletia\" genus and assigned to it two subspecies \"Aletia falsidica falsidica\" and \"Aletia falsidica hamiltoni\". In 2019 Robert Hoare undertook a major review of New Zealand Noctuidae. During this review the genus \"Ichneutica\" was greatly expanded and the genus \"Aletia\" was subsumed into that genus as a synonym. As a result of this review, this species is now known as \"Ichneutica falsidica.\"\nDescription.\nMeyrick described the species as follows:\nThis species is variable in appearance. \"I. falsidica\" is similar in appearance to \"I. panda\" but the former usually has dark dashes along the hind-wings\".\" \"I. panda\" is normally the smaller of the two species. The wingspan of \"I. falsidica\" males is between 37 and 42\u00a0mm and between 40 and 44\u00a0mm for females.\nDistribution.\nIt is endemic to New Zealand.

Its lyrics express the position of the British coal miners who had been on strike during the year prior to the album's release, addressed to the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. They tell of the miners' deep attachment to their work and its importance to the country's economy and culture, alluding to William Blake's poem \"And did those feet in ancient time\", while criticising Thatcher's economic policies, particularly the effort to shift from coal to nuclear power as Britain's primary source of energy.\nSting was moved to write the song by his own youth in Northumberland, outside Newcastle, where many communities depended economically on mining. He felt no one during the strike had made the case for continued coal use and the dangers posed by nuclear power. His father had worked in shipbuilding, another industry that had once dominated the British economy but had been diminishing in importance in the later 20th century. He drew the melody line from a song he had co-written and recorded as a member of the mid-1970s British jazz band Last Exit. It was released as a single in Germany, Australia and New Zealand; a live version was filmed the following year for \"Bring on the Night\" and its soundtrack album. Sting re-recorded it with a different arrangement in 1993 for \"Ten Summoner's Tales\" and then adapted it for symphony orchestra on 2010's \"Symphonicities\".\nCritics generally liked the song, at least musically. They have noted in particular how its insistent, repetitive synthesizer figure and unchanging backing percussion rhythm suggest a contrast between machinery and the humanity represented by Sting's vocal and Branford Marsalis's soprano saxophone fills. It also has been seen as an evolution in Sting's protest music, the first time he devoted a song to environmental issues. The lyrics drew a mixed reaction; scientists have criticised the song for its inaccurate statement that carbon-14 is dangerously radioactive, when in fact it is a widespread product of natural decay that is harmless in those quantities and instead used for carbon dating. Three decades after its release, Sting said he had revised his opinion of nuclear energy in response to climate change and now saw it more favourably.\nEconomic, political and social context.\nWhen Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom following the victory of her Conservative Party in the 1979 elections, one of her goals was to add to Britain's nuclear power generating capacity. She had been impressed by France's Messmer plan, enacted in response to the 1973 oil crisis. It had led to the construction of 58 new reactors in the late 1970s, making France less dependent on foreign oil imports and eliminating the use of coal, a result also achieved in neighbouring Belgium. Britain, by contrast, had pioneered the use of commercial nuclear power in the 1950s but since then had lagged behind, with its useful reactors ageing into obsolescence while newer projects like Dungeness B became national embarrassments as construction costs and delays escalated. A second oil shock later that year underscored the urgency. In October of that year, Secretary of State for Energy David Howell announced to Parliament the government's plan to add 15 gigawatts of nuclear generating capacity by building roughly one new reactor every year for 10 years. Thatcher echoed this announcement two months later with firmer details of a program.\nThe Tories also had a political reason to embrace nuclear power. Their previous government had been defeated in an election held during a wintertime strike by coal miners, who worked at the nationalised mines run by the National Coal Board (NCB). Two years earlier, Prime Minister Edward Heath's government had increased miners' pay after another miners' strike, and this time the government was less willing to negotiate, making the election a referendum on the strike under the slogan \"Who governs Britain?\". The electorate answered that challenge by returning the opposition Labour Party, more closely allied with the National Union of Miners (NUM), to power.\nMany of the Conservatives who entered the party's leadership, including Thatcher, never forgot what they considered a humiliating defeat by NUM and Arthur Scargill, a regional union leader in Yorkshire where the largest group of miners were concentrated, whose use of mobile flying pickets had secured the union's victory. They credited public discontent with British unions fostered by the Winter of Discontent, several weeks of strikes by unions representing hauliers, garbage workers, gravediggers and other government workers aggravated by severe winter weather that combined to nearly paralyze the country, with their electoral victory. As a result, they broke with previous Conservative governments in embracing more explicitly libertarian free-market economic theories that became known as Thatcherism. One element was that unions could not be allowed to exercise such control over the British economy as they had been, or had been perceived as doing, under governments of both parties since World War II.\nBritish coal mining, which had once powered the Industrial Revolution and made mine owners and operators wealthy at the expense of the miners who risked their lives doing dirty and dangerous work that had led to unionisation and widespread labour unrest earlier in the 20th century, had declined considerably by the early 1980s. The total number of miners had declined by 80 per cent from those earlier eras, many of the richer and more accessible coal seams had been depleted and only government subsidies kept mining profitable. Many pits remained open as Scargill and NUM had vowed to fight any closures for any reasons but safety.\nIn 1981, the government proposed closing 20 pits but backed down after union opposition and the threat of another strike. The following year, Scargill was elected NUM's president on the strength of his promise to oppose any closures unless the pit was unsafe or exhausted. The government responded in 1983 by appointing Sir Ian McGregor to head the NCB following his tenure at British Steel, where he had made redundant 95,000 jobs in the course of making it profitable enough to be privatised. He proposed closing the same 20 pits, which Scargill attacked as intended more to break the union than improve the NCB's books.\nDespite having dropped its planned closures in 1981 in the face of a strike threat, the government was actively preparing for the eventuality of another. Following the Ridley Plan, drawn up by Nicholas Ridley, another Conservative MP convinced that a Tory government had to win a national strike to control unions for the benefit of the economy, it had stockpiled coal at power stations and prepared to bring closed oil-fired plants back online. Nuclear power, though limited at the time, was part of the plan. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, another strong Thatcherite, saw it as \"the means of emancipation from Arthur Scargill.\"\nIn March 1984 miners at a South Yorkshire pit walked off the job over closures and called for a national strike, a call echoed by Scargill but not fully implemented by all regions due to the lack of a unionwide vote. Coal use declined by a third during the strike; nuclear power helped make up the difference. Almost a year later, the strike ended with the miners having gained nothing. Pit closures began soon afterwards.\nComposition.\nSting combined a melody line from a song he had recorded a decade earlier with lyrics about the miners' strike, which was ongoing as he wrote, recorded and mixed the song for \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" sessions at Blue Wave, Eddy Grant's studio in Barbados, and Le Studio in Quebec north of Montreal.\nIn a \"New Musical Express\" (NME) interview at the time of \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" was released, Sting discussed the background of the song. In his native Wallsend, outside the city of Newcastle in North East England, boys who did not finish grammar school had the choice of working at the Swan Hunter shipyard where his father had worked, or in the Rising Sun coal pit outside town, if they wanted to remain in the area and earn a living wage. Before his musical career, Sting taught in a Northumberland village where \"all the children's fathers were miners. The area I was brought up in was literally built on coal.\"\nBy then, both the pit and the shipyard had been closed. \"There are 300 years of coal supplies left, and they're closing all these pits\", he lamented. \"And I frankly think the government has got its head up its arse. They're destroying communities that are culturally very rich [and] offering them no alternative, saying you're completely useless.\"\nSting was also critical of the government's plan to replace coal with nuclear power, pointing to the Hartlepool nuclear plant outside Middlesbrough, south of Wallsend, which required uranium imports from South Africa to function. He had once supported nuclear power himself, but then said that he changed his mind when he learned more about it. \"Those machines were turned on 20 years ago and they don't know how to turn them off. Now they're falling to bits and they don't know how to repair them. It's frightening.\" Sting also said friends who work in the nuclear industry \"telephone me occasionally with horror stories about how dangerous and inept the whole system is.\"\n\"Also I felt that during the miners' strike\", Sting continued, \"the case for coal was never put to the nation. Kinnock didn't explain it, Arthur Scargill didn't even address it, it was complete personality rhetoric with Thatcher. And the case for coal is really strong.\" Ultimately, he said:\nMusic.\n\"We Work the Black Seam\" is in at a tempo of 120 beats per minute, opening in the key of A minor. Initially it follows a chord progression of Am-C-Em7, a i-III-v progression that alternates with Am-F-Dm7 (i-VI-iv), throughout the verse. At the chorus, the synthesizer changes to playing just the background chords as the song modulates to the key of F, with the progression F-C-D-a, repeated three times in full. On the fourth, the progression stops at D on the words \"carbon fourteen\", after which the bass and synthesizer play a scale descending from F to A, facilitating the return to A minor for the song's title to be sung twice before the next verse.\nThe song fades in with a repeating six-note keyboard figure in a vibraphone-like voice in open fourths and fifths, played on the downbeats, that critic Jon Pareles likened to \"the clang of picks\". Christopher Gable, author of \"The Words and Music of Sting\", traces the use of the open fourths and fifths to English folk music. Behind it is a percussion track consisting of three eighth notes on a bass drum surrounding beat two and a snare hit on beat four, both of which remain consistent throughout the entire song. Gable sees this as, along with the song's fading in and then out and the end, suggesting a factory in continuous production, creating tension between the humanity of the melody and the rigid backing track that accentuates the theme of the lyrics. Paul Carr similarly notes this \"appears to be deliberately 'industrial', automated, with a mechanised avoidance of feeling.\" He finds it complemented by the horns during the choruses, evoking the colliery bands in most British mining communities.\nWhen the music reaches full volume, guitar, soprano saxophone and synthesizer fills enter. The saxophone's opening phrase, beginning on a rising fifth. During the chorus, the saxophone plays a countermelody setting up the descending scale that marks the return to A minor. Gable sees this as accentuating the chorus's expressed lyrical hopefulness that the miners' grievances with nuclear power will be better appreciated in the future. Afterwards, as the title is sung, it plays the same phrase as it does in the intro, marking a return to the present. \nThe melody, which Pareles described as \"winding... suggest[ing] climbing and descending\", was described by Sting as \"hav[ing] lain among my mental notes for perhaps ten years\", in the liner notes to the soundtrack album for \"Bring on the Night\", a 1986 documentary about the making of \"Turtles\", in which the song is shown being recorded. While those notes imply he had never been able to use it, due to his inability to finish it or \"find suitable lyrics\", it was in fact the melody line of \"Savage Beast\", a song he had recorded in 1975 when part of the British jazz fusion band Last Exit.\nGable notes that the verse melody line, in the Dorian mode, is additive: \"Each phrase fragment builds upon the last, until the third and final phrase makes a grand arc from the tonic note 'a' up to a high 'b' and back down again.\" The chorus melody shows less variation, which to him accentuates the difference between the focus of the verse lyrics on the present and the chorus's turn to the future.\nIn his 2019 doctoral dissertation on Sting's music for Canada's York University, Christopher Rait finds \"a number of appealing rhythmic devices\" in \"We Work the Black Seam\", which he traces to swing influence. The opening instrumental melodies, stretching the intro's Aeolian mode intro with some extensions, introduce rhythmic dissonance with the underlying Charleston rhythm, their syncopation becoming hypersyncopation when the vocals enter.\nLyrics.\nThe lyrics take the form of a dramatic monologue. The singer speaks on behalf, and as one, of the miners, always using \"we\" and addressing an unnamed person or persons. He tells them in the opening lines: \"\"This place has changed for good / Your economic theory said it would / It's hard for us to understand / We can't give up our jobs the way we should\". In the second verse, the singer alludes to the many accidents and deaths that have occurred in mines while the miners \"tunneled deep inside the nation's soul\" (and, later \"walk through ancient forest lands / And light a thousand cities with our hands\"). This impact cannot be measured monetarily, and so \"your economic theory makes no sense.\"\" These lines have been taken as an attack on Thatcherism.\nIn the chorus, which makes its first appearance after the second verse, the song raises the nuclear issue; Paul Carr notes a change in tone that suggests the chorus is addressed to the miners alone. The singer hopes that in a future \"nuclear age / They may understand our rage\". He alludes to the maintenance difficulties Sting told the \"NME\" of having heard about from his friends, and then the government's reasons for phasing out coal in favour of nuclear energy:\nThe next verse alludes to \"And did those feet in ancient time\", an early 19th-century poem by William Blake that a young Sting would likely have studied in grammar school, later adapted into the Anglican hymn, \"Jerusalem\", in describing the nuclear plants as \"\"dark satanic mills\" [that] \"have made redundant all our mining skills\". It concludes with a warning that \"all the poisoned streams in Cumberland\"\" are too high a price to pay for abandoning coal.\nRecording.\n\"We Work the Black Seam\" was one of the last tracks on the album to be recorded at Eddy Grant's Blue Wave Studios in Barbados before those sessions concluded in March 1985. Afterwards he took the master tapes to New York to share with executives at A&amp;M Records, his label, and then went to Le Studio, in Morin-Heights, Quebec, Canada, north of Montreal, to mix the album. Sting produced the track himself along with Pete Smith.\nReleases.\n\"We Work the Black Seam\" was the first track on the second side of the vinyl and cassette release of \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\", released in June 1985, and the sixth out of 10 tracks overall, between \"Shadows in the Rain\" and \"Consider Me Gone\". At 5 minutes and 42 seconds long, it is the album's longest track.\nIt was released as a single in Australia, Germany and New Zealand a year after the album, the sixth single from it in those countries. \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\", the album's title track and its shortest track, was the B-side.\nOther versions.\nIn late 1985, Sting and the jazz musicians he had recorded \"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\" with gathered in Paris to rehearse for a short European tour. They performed at several venues in the French capital; filmmaker Michael Apted made a documentary, \"Bring on the Night\" of the rehearsals and shows. Sting and backing vocalists Janice Pendarvis and Dolette McDonald are shown rehearsing their parts on \"We Work the Black Seam\" in which they sing the title lines, accompanied by a drum machine and synthesizer playing all the musical parts. The scene segues into a performance of the song with the band at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy with an arrangement similar to the recorded version save for the backing vocals; saxophonist Branford Marsalis is applauded after playing the melody line as a solo. The performance shown in the film is also included on the soundtrack album, where it runs to nearly 7 minutes.\nEight years later, in 1993, Sting re-recorded \"We Work the Black Seam\", with Hugh Padgham co-producing, during sessions for his album \"Ten Summoner's Tales\". He chose not to include it on the album, and it was instead released on two different singles: the US CD single of \"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\", as \"We Work the Black Seam (1993)\" and as the B-side to the UK 7-inch release of \"Fields of Gold\". The latter release omitted the parenthetical from the title.\nOn his 2010 album \"Symphonicities\", Sting sang over orchestral arrangements of his songs performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, following a tour where the two had performed together. Among them was \"We Work the Black Seam\". The arrangement, the longest version of the song on record at 7:18, features more brass than the other songs on the album, and is primarily built around the melody line, with the saxophone fills and backing line of the original heard at times. Sting also changed some of the lyrics.\nMusic video.\nA video was filmed to accompany the song's release in Germany. In it, Sting stands in a mansion's ballroom amid furniture and mannequins, covered in plastic wrap, singing the song.\nReception.\nUpon release.\nCritics reviewing the album took note of \"We Work the Black Seam\". Most found the music praiseworthy. \"The sounds of delicately malletted percussion, organ and light saxophone licks lend [it] a hymnlike ethereality\", wrote Stephen Holden in \"The New York Times\". \"The arrangement also illuminates the song's deeper contemplation of power hidden in the earth and its comparisons between the irresponsible exploitation of human labor and of natural resources.\" In \"Rolling Stone\", Pareles singled out the song's \"transparency\". \"Billboard\" called it \"ambitious... the work of an original artist\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" labelled the song as \"an extraordinary ballad\u00a0... which builds on a minimal five-note figure and [Branford] Marsalis' atonal accents\". \"The Miami Herald\"s Tom Moon called the song's \"shrill, almost panicked chorus\" one of the album's \"moments of ecstatic music\". Contrarily, Richard Williams in \"The Times\" complained that the song \"lacks the mysterious dimension that turns propaganda into art.\"\nThe song's lyrics drew a more mixed reaction. Richard Harrington, reviewing a Sting concert in \"The Washington Post\", commented that the \"Black Seam\" of the song's title \"could also stand as a metaphor for Sting's longtime passion for various Afro-American and Caribbean styles.\" Pareles found the \"neat denunciations of Thatcherism\" in the first verse offset by the \"goofy stuff about the universe\" in the later lyrics, and advised listeners to \"dump the lyric sheet\". He also implied that Sting's concern about the long-term effects of carbon-14 in the chorus resulted from it rhyming where plutonium does not. Other writers have taken note of this scientific inaccuracy, as carbon-14, while radioactive, is a common naturally occurring isotope that accumulates in the human body as well as the environment and, at an approximately 0.01\u00a0mSv/year dose per person, does not pose any health threat, while allowing for his broader point that nuclear waste remains radioactive and hazardous for very long periods of time.\nLater years.\nCritics and scholars looking back on \"We Work the Black Seam\" in later years have seen it as a significant step in Sting's development as a writer and performer of protest music. He had begun writing such songs with \"Driven to Tears\" on the 1980 Police album \"Zenyatta Mondatta\", and continued with some more on the band's next album, \"Ghost in the Machine\", but largely eschewed them on \"Synchronicity\", the last Police album. Gable notes that \"We Work the Black Seam\" is Sting's first protest song built around environmentalist themes, a cause he would become more strongly associated with later in his solo career, particularly protection of the world's rainforests.\nSting's perspective on the merits of coal over nuclear power changed with time. Commenting on the lyrics in 2009, he wrote, \"Neither source of power is ideal, but that would be another song.\" Seven years later, in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", he said that climate change had led him to reassess that point of view even further. \"If we're going to tackle global warming, I think nuclear power is the only way you can create massive amounts of power.\"\nSince 1985, the UK has greatly reduced its use of coal-fired power. By 2017 only 10 pits remained open and coal accounted for only 2 per cent of the electricity generated; the country has increasingly gone for periods of days at a time without having to burn any coal. The government originally planned to phase it out completely by 2025, but Energy and Climate Change Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan announced in June 2021 that the deadline to phaseout coal would occur one year earlier than planned. While nuclear accounts for 20 per cent of British power, only one of the ten reactors Thatcher called for was ever built, and all the other reactors will have to be retired by 2030. The difference has been made up for by the \"dash for gas\" from the North Sea following the privatisation of Britain's electric grid in the years after the miners' strike; gas turned out to be cheaper and cleaner than coal.\nCover versions.\nThe British folk group Swan Arcade has recorded an \"a cappella\" cover version, under the name \"Black Seam\". Irish group Lankum include a verse of the song on their album \"Live in Dublin\" at the end of track 4, \"The Pride of Petravore\".", "Isaac Rouaud\n\nIsaac Thomas Joseph Rouaud-Simon (born 12 February 1998) is a Haitian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Championnat National 3 club Amilly and the Haiti national team.\nClub career.\nBorn in Haiti, Rouaud-Simon moved to France after being adopted at a young age and began his career with the reserves of Le Mans, before stints with Saint-Malo, and Vannes.

His representative works include the \"Xie\" series about a boy living in the mysterious Platoon City, and the cover art of the magazine \"Bikkuri House\". He died suddenly in January 2008. Yuji Kamosawa's worldview was strongly influenced by the writer Taruho Inagaki. His work \"Mr. Xie's Night Walk\" (\u30af\u30b7\u30fc\u541b\u306e\u591c\u306e\u6563\u6b69) was considered particularly outstanding.\nHis illustrations were used in music for the jackets of \"Bikkuri Aquarium\" and \"Science Fiction\" produced by Keiichi Suzuki, as well as for the Moonriders tribute album. The singer-songwriter Masahito Arai was also a fan and used many of Kamosawa's illustrations for the jackets of his solo albums.

Notable people include:", "Ariston Club\n\nThe Ariston Club is a building in Mar del Plata, Argentina designed by Marcel Breuer. It is part of the Modern Movement, and complies with four of the five Le Corbusier's Points of Architecture: pilotis, free designing of the floor plan, free designing of the fa\u00e7ade, horizontal windows.\nSince 2019, it is a National Historic Monument of Argentina.\nHistory.\nBuilt in two months during 1948, it is Breuer's only work in Latin America. Its construction was commissioned by the University of Buenos Aires School of Architecture, and local architects Carlos Coire and Eduardo Catalano associated on the project. It was designed to promote the sale of lots in a nearby real state development.\nSince 1993, it has been abandoned.\nDesign.\nIts design, which features a floating concrete double clover, supported by four thin pillars that are not visible from the outside\u2014and featuring volcanic lava tiles\u2014surrounded by wave-shaped glass and wood, is considered to be ahead of its time. It was built using regional materials as well, such as the stone used in the back wall and wood used in the cladding and openings.\nUses.\nInitially, the building was designed to hold a cafeteria and restaurant. Its designed allowed for all tables to be placed next to a window.\nIts golden age was during the fifties when the restaurant was operating. However, from then on, the building fell on disgrace. Several cafeterias used it during the seventies, and, during the eighties, the Bruma y Arena (Mist &amp; Sand) caf\u00e9-bar was installed. Then, the Maryana dancing club followed. During the nineties, it housed the Parrilla Perico barbecue. These uses modified the original structure and downgraded the building's design.\nPresent day.\nIn 2019, as the Ariston Club was declared National Historical Monument, a proposal for restoration was started, alongside a Change.org petition. There were concerns about possible structural damage caused by the abandonment and marine corrosion (as the building is located next to the sea), that could impede the restoration. However, a technical report concluded the restoration was possible, as the structural damage was low and limited to certain areas.", "Dutherson Clerveaux\n\nDutherson Clerveaux (born 20 January 1999) is a Haitian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for the club Cavaly, and the Haiti national team.\nInternational career.\nClerveaux debuted with the Haiti national team in a 3\u20131 friendly win over Guyana on 11 June 2019.

He came to national prominence due to his involvement in the killing of David Byrne in 2016 and the subsequent criminal investigation.\nCareer.\nHe founded a business in 2007.\nMembership of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nIn September 2014 he announced his retirement from his role as councillor, citing health reasons. Mary Lou McDonald described him as \"a hard worker who will be missed in his elected role by local constituents\". A few days later he claimed that a \"small element\" in the North Inner City section of the party had spread rumours about him. He had not officially resigned from the council but had quit Sinn F\u00e9in.\nThe following month he announced that he was staying with the party after having a discussion with party figures. In February 2015 he resigned. In late June 2015 he claimed he had been bullied out of Sinn F\u00e9in, claims which Mary Lou McDonald disputed on 1 July 2015.\nAbduction of Alexander Hurley.\nIn January 2015 Dowdall advertised a BMW motorbike for sale on DoneDeal and was contacted by Alexander Hurley, who made an offer for the bike. Hurley had prior convictions for fraud, and Dowdall found allegations of fraud when researching Hurley.\nDowdall invited Hurley to have dinner on 15 January 2015, but when Hurley arrived at the house he was taken to the garage where he was tied to a chair with cable ties. He was waterboarded and his life and the lives of his family were threatened. The Dowdalls accused him of having stolen a car from someone and demanded that he tell the truth. Jonathan wore a balaclava. There was also a third, unidentified man and a girl who brought a bucket and teatowel and who also videoed the events. The video recordings were found when Garda searched his house in relation to other matters. The ordeal ended at 10pm and Hurley was released at 10:35pm.\nDowdall claimed he was in the IRA, and during Dowdall's trial in 2017, Ms Justice Isobel Kennedy returned judgement in a Newton hearing to accept the allegations of threats and his claim of IRA membership.\nTrial and sentences.\nBoth Jonathan and his father pleaded guilty to falsely imprisoning Hurley on 15 January 2015 at an address in Navan Road, to detaining him without his consent and to threatening to kill him. Dowdall was jailed for 12 years and his father Patrick for eight. Judge Kennedy described the ordeal as \"gratuitous, humiliating and degrading\".\nOn 23 April 2018 the Court of Appeal reduced Jonathan's sentence to 10 years imprisonment with the final 25 months suspended and that of his father to 7 years with the final 3 years suspended.\nReactions.\nMary Lou McDonald said after the conviction: \"I welcome the conviction of Jonathan Dowdall in court today. The details of the attack perpetrated by him are deeply shocking. Jonathan Dowdall left Sinn F\u00e9in some years ago. He subsequently worked with, and supported, a political opponent of Sinn F\u00e9in in the Dublin Central Constituency.\"\nRegency Hotel shooting.\nIn April 2021 he was charged with the murder of David Byrne.\nBoth Dowdall and Gerry Hutch, who was also charged with the murder, claimed in judicial review before the High Court that trial before the Special Criminal Court would be unlawful and a breach of their fundamental rights because the court was acting as a permanent institution after being established on a temporary basis. These were dismissed by Mr Anthony Barr, who ruled that the legislation was neither temporary nor had any temporal limit. Both Dowdall and Hutch sought leave to appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court. On 5 May 2022 a panel reserved judgement in both cases. The following day, the court president was told that Dowdall was also appealing Barr's judgement via the appellate court. After a request from counsel for the Attorney General, the case was adjourned until 1 July 2022, pending the Supreme Court decision.\nIn September 2022 both Jonathan and his father Patrick pleaded guilty to facilitating the murder of David Byrne.\nOn 3 October 2022 the Special Criminal Court was told that Jonathan Dowdall was willing to be a witness in the Regency shooting trial. The trial was adjourned for a week. Though Dowdall had been convicted of facilitating the murder, the charge of murder against him had been dropped. Dowdall is under Garda protection and is being assessed for the witness protection programme.", "Israeli Labor Party primaries\n\nSince the 1992 Israeli legislative election, the Israeli Labor Party has selected its party lists through primary elections in which party members are eligible to participate. This has been the case in all elections since 1992, with the exceptions of the September 2019 and 2020 legislative elections, in which the party based its party list off of the results of the primary previously held in advance of the April 2019 legislative election.\nLabor's practice of using primaries to determine their party list is unusual among parties in Israel. In Israel, most parties instead decide their party lists either through a nomination committee or by prerogative of the party leaders.\nBackground.\nBefore moving to primaries in 1992, the party had previously chosen its party list through a closed process involving party leaders for every election, with the exception of the 1988 Knesset election, for which the party instead used an open process in which 1,267 members of the party's Central Committee selected the list in convention.\n1992.\n108,347 party members voted in the 1992 primary, marking 70.10% turnout.\n1996.\n194,788 party members voted in the 1996 primary, marking 74.60% turnout.\n1999.\n101,087 party members voted in the 1999 primary, marking 62.00% turnout.\n2002.\n58,783 party members voted in the 2002 primary, marking 53.00% turnout.\n2006.\n68,331 party members voted in the 2006 primary, marking 58.40% turnout.\n2008.\n31,789 party members voted in the 2008 primary, marking 53.90% turnout.\n2012.\n35,035 party members voted in the 2012 primary, marking 58.00% turnout.\nThe order that the top candidates finished in were as follows:\n2015.\nThe party held its primary on 13 January 2015. 28,742 party members voted in the primary, marking 58.80% turnout.\n2019.\nOn 11 February 2011, the Labor Party held its primary in advance of the April 2019 legislative election. 33,672 party members voted in the primary (held in advance of the April 2019 legislative election), marking 56.30% turnout.\nThe party would subsequently use the results of this primary to also choose its party lists for the September 2019 and the 2020 legislative elections, instead of holding new primaries for these elections. Neither of the Knessets elected by the April 2019 nor September 2019 had succeeded in forming a government.\n2021.\nThe 2021 primary took place on 1 February less than two weeks after the party's 24 January leadership election. 18,106 party members voted in the primary, marking a turnout of roughly 40%.\nThe primary had originally been cancelled after the party voted at its November 2020 convention 66% to 33% to have the 3,800 activists eligible to vote at the party's convention select the nominees instead of the party's general membership, a move orchestrated by then-Labor Party chairman Amir Peretz. However, on 3 January 2021, the Tel Aviv District Court ruled that the move to cancel primary was illegal.\nIn the primary, voters were able to vote for between five and seven individuals from a list of 62 candidates.\n2022.\nThe primary for the electoral list to be used in the 2022 Israeli legislative election was held on August 9, 2022.

The term was coined in by sociologists Mitchell Duneier and Harvey Molotch in their study of interactions on the streets of New York City between black men who were panhandlers or street venders, and middle-class white women who were passing by. The study used conversation analysis to show that women were unlikely to respond to the men's comments or questions; when the men persisted despite the women's unwillingness to engage in conversation, they violated the rules of social conduct and committed interactional vandalism.", "Maquinaria y Elementos de Transporte\n\nMaquinaria y Elementos de Transporte, also known as Maquitrans or by the abbreviation MT is a former bus modification and Spanish car manufacturer based in Barcelona.\nHistory.\nThe company was established in the 1940s as a subsidiary of Tranv\u00edas de Barcelona. Its main purpose was to adapt old buses for use as trolleybuses to avoid the fuel shortages after the Spanish Civil War. The companys name was shortened to MT. It was located on Luchana Street, Barcelona. In the 1950s it began to manufacture scooters and three wheel motor bikes. Microcar production occurred in 1957.\nTrolley Buses.\nFrom 1941 to 1949 Marquitrans made two types of trolley buses, single and double deck models. In total 40 buses were built.\nMotorscooters.\nFrom 1950 Marquitrans began to focus on motor scooters and three wheel cargo scooters. All were powered by a single cylinder 175 cc 7\u00a0hp engine. For the cargo scooters, it was mounted in front of the single rear wheel with a mid-engine design. This engine made it possible to reach maximum speeds close to 70\u00a0km/h.\nMicrocar.\nThe microcar was based on the three wheel cargo scooter and had the same chassis, but the handlebars were replaced by a steering wheel. The body was open and provided enough space for two people. The first prototype has been preserved. It was taken as the basis for the definitive model, after adding a complete fairing to the rear of the engine, leaving all the mechanics hidden. About 20 units were made of the final model, of which only the prototype is known to have survived.\nMototrans.\nIn 1958 the company partnered with Cliper, a Barcelona importer of Italian Ducati motorcycles and both formed Mototrans, a company dedicated to the manufacture of Ducati motorcycles. The company survived until 1982.", "Cape Christian Academy\n\nCape Christian Academy is a private Christian school serving students in preschool to twelfth grade, located in Middle Township, in Cape May County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

The former opened, initially with grades Kindergarten through 2, either in 1976, or in September 1977, with an initial enrollment of 45\u201350. Its founder was Betty Gillingham. South Cape opened after CMCCS opened. South Cape, at Covenant Bible Church, was located in an area of Lower Township with a North Cape May postal address, though as of 2010 it was outside of the North Cape May CDP. Robert Thomson (died 1988), who is considered to be another co-founder of Cape Christian, served on the board of directors of one of the predecessor schools.\nThe initial enrollment was 300. Originally the merged school used rented facilities. The Kindergarten through grade 3 and 8-12 buildings were rented from Faith Fellowship Chapel and were located in Middle Township. The K-3 building had a total of of area and also had offices. First Assembly of God Church in Lower Township housed some of the Kindergarten and first grade classes. Covenant Bible Church housed grades 4\u20137. By 1993 it had 380 students.\nIn 1993, the school bought its current campus from Faith Fellowship Chapel. The purchase included the K-3 building, but not the 8-12 building. By 1994 it had two campuses. The student count that year was almost 350. In 1995 the student count was about 350 and it still had two campuses.", "List of aqueous ions by element\n\nThis table lists the ionic species that are most likely to be present, depending on pH, in aqueous solutions of binary salts of metal ions. The existence must be inferred on the basis of indirect evidence provided by modelling with experimental data or by analogy with structures obtained by X-ray crystallography.\nIntroduction.\nWhen a salt of a metal ion, with the generic formula MXn, is dissolved in water, it will dissociate into a cation and anions.\n(aq) signifies that the ion is aquated, with cations having a chemical formula [M(H2O)p]q+ and anions whose state of aquation is generally unknown. For convenience (aq) is not shown in the rest of this article as the \"number\" of water molecules that are attached to the ions is irrelevant in regard to hydrolysis. This reaction occurs quantitatively with salts of the alkali-metals at low to moderate concentrations.\nWith salts of divalent metal ions, the aqua-ion will be subject to a dissociation reaction, known as hydrolysis, a name derived from Greek words for water splitting. The first step in this process can be written as\nWhen the pH of the solution is increased by adding an alkaline solution to it, the extent of hydrolysis increases. Measurements of pH or colour change are used to derive the equilibrium constant for the reaction. Further hydrolysis may occur, producing dimeric, trimeric or polymeric species containing hydroxy- or oxy- groups. The next step is to determine which model for the chemical processes best fits the experimental data.\nModel selection.\nThe model is defined in terms of a list of those complex species which are present in solutions in significant amounts. In the present context the complex species have the general formula [MpOq(OH)r]n\u00b1. where p, q and r define the stoichiometry of the species and n\u00b1 gives the electrical charge of the ion. The experimental data are fitted to those models which may represent the species that are formed in solution. The model which gives the best fit is selected for publication. However, the pH range in which data may be collected is limited by the fact that an hydroxide with formula M(OH)n will be formed at relatively low pH, as illustrated at the right. This will make the process of model selection difficult when monomers and dimers are formed. and virtually impossible when higher polymers are also formed. In those cases it \"must be assumed\" that the species found in solids are also present in solutions.\nThe formation of an hydroxo-bridged species is enthalpically favoured over the monomers, countering the unfavourable entropic effect of aggregation. For this reason, it is difficult to establish models in which both types of species are present.\nMonomeric hydrolysis products.\nThe extent of hydrolysis can be quantified when the values of the hydrolysis constants can be determined experimentally. The first hydrolysis constant refers to the equilibrium\nThe \"association\" constant for this reaction can be expressed as\nNumerical values for this equilibrium constant can be found in papers concerned only with metal ion hydrolysis. However, it is more useful, in general, to use the acid dissociation constant, Ka. \nand to cite the cologarithm, pKa, of the value of this quantity in books and other publications. The two values are constrained by the relationship\npKw refers to the self-ionization of water: pK = log (1/K) = -log(K).\nFurther monomeric complexes may be formed in a stepwise manner.\nDimeric species.\nHydrolysed species containing two metal ions, with the general formula M2(OH)n, may be formed from pre-existing monomeric species. The stepwise reaction\nillustrates the process. An alternative stepwise reaction\nmay also occur. Unfortunately it is not possible to distinguish between these two possibilities using data from potentiometric titrations because both of these reactions have no effect on the pH of the solution.\nThe concentration of a dimeric species decreases more rapidly with metal ion concentration than does the concentration of the corresponding monomeric species. Therefore, when determining the stability constants of both species it is usually necessary to obtain data from 2 or more titrations, each with a different metal salt concentration. Otherwise the stability constant non-linear least squares refinement may fail without providing the desired values, due to there being 100% mathematical correlation between the refinement parameters for the monomeric and dimeric species.\nTrimeric and polymeric species.\nThe principal problem when determining the stability constant for a polymeric species is how to select the \"best\" model to use from a number of possibilities. An example that illustrates the problem is shown in Baes &amp; Mesmer, p.\u00a0119.\nA trimeric species must be formed from a chemical reaction of a dimer with a monomer, with the implication that the value of the stability constant of the dimer must be \"known\", having been determined using separate experimental data. In practice this extremely difficult to achieve. Instead, it is generally assumed that the species in solution are the same as the species that have been identified in crystal structure determinations. There is no way to establish whether or not the assumption is justified. Furthermore, species that are required as intermediaries between the monomer and the polymer may have such low concentrations as to be \"undetectable\".\nAn extreme example concerns the species with a cluster of 13 aluminium(III) ions, which can be isolated in the solid state; there must be at least 12 intermediate species in solution, which have not been characterized. It follows that the published stoichiometry of the polymeric species in solution may well be correct, but it is always possible that other species are actually present in solution. In general, the omission of intermediary species will affect the reliability of the published speciation schemes.\nSoluble hydroxides.\nSome hydroxides of non-metallic elements are soluble in water; they are not included in the following table. Examples cited by Baes and Mesmer (p.\u00a0413) include hydroxides of Gallium(III), Indium(III), Thallium(III), Arsenic(III), Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III). Most hydroxides of transition metals are classified as being \"insoluble\" in water. Some of them dissolve, with reaction, in alkaline solution.\nList.\nFor some highly radioactive elements, such as astatine and radon, only trace quantities have been experimented on. As such, unambiguous characterisation of the species they form is impossible, and so their species have been excluded from the table below. Some theoretical speculations as to what they might be are present in the literature; more information can be found at the main articles of the elements involved.\nPeriodic table distribution.\nThe occurrence of the different kinds of ions of the elements is shown in this periodic table:\nPeriodic table notes.\nRather than the periodic table being the sum of its groups and periods an examination of the image shows several patterns Thus, there is a largely a left-to-right transition in metallic character seen in the red-orange-sand-yellow colours for the metals, and the turquoise, blue and violet colours for the nonmetals. The dashed line seen in the periods 1 to 4 corresponds to notions of a dividing line between metals and nonmetals. The mixed species in periods 5 and 6 shows how much trouble chemists can have in assessing where to continue the dividing line. The separate dashed boundary around the Nb-Ta-W-Tc-Re-Os-Ir hexad is an exemplar for the reputation many transition metals have for nonmetallic chemistry.\n\u24b6\u2009 Hydrogen is shown as being a cation former but most of its chemistry, \"can be explained in terms of its tendency to [eventually] acquire the electronic configuration of\u2026helium\", thereby behaving predominately as a nonmetal.\n\u24b7\u2009 Beryllium has an isodiagonal relationship with aluminium, in group 13, such a relationship also occurring between B and Si; and C and P.\n\u24b8\u2009 Cation-only elements are shown as being limited to sixteen elements: all those in group 1, and the heavier actinides.\n\u24b9\u2009 Rare earth metals are the group 3 metals scandium, yttrium, lutetium and the lanthanides; scandium is the only such metal shown as being capable of forming an oxyanion.\n\u24ba Radioactive elements, such as the actinides, are harder to study. The known species may not represent the whole of what is possible, and the identifications may sometimes be in doubt. Astatine, as another example, is highly radioactive, and determining its stable species is \"clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted, and the possibility of reactions with impurities, walls and filters, or radioactivity by-products, and other unwanted nano-scale interactions. Equally, as Kirby noted, \u201csince the trace chemistry of I sometimes differs significantly from its own macroscopic chemistry, analogies drawn between At and I are likely to be questionable, at best.\"\n\u24bb\u2009 The earlier actinides, up to uranium, show some superficial resemblance to their transition metal counterparts in groups 3 to 9.\n\u24bc\u2009 Most of the transition metals are known for their nonmetallic chemistry, and this is particularly seen in the image for periods 5 and 6, groups 5 to 9. They nevertheless have the relatively high electrical conductivity values characteristic of metals.\n\u24bd\u2009 The transition metals (or d-block metals) further show electrochemical character, in terms of their capacity to form positive or negative ions, that is in-between that of (i) the s and f-block metals; and (ii) the p-block elements.\n\u24be\u2009 The p-block shows a relatively distinct cutoff in periods 1 to 4 between elements commonly recognised as metals and nonmetals. Periods 5 and 6 include elements commonly recognised as metalloids by authors who recognise such a class or subclass (antimony and tellurium), and elements less commonly recognised as such (polonium and astatine).\n\u24bf\u2009 Stein, in 1987, showed the metalloid elements as occupying a zone in the p-block composed of B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Po, Te, At and Rn. In the periodic table image these elements are found on the right or upper side of the dashed line traversing the p-block.\n\u24c0\u2009 Of 103 elements shown in the image, just ten form anions, all of these being in the p-block: arsenic; the five chalcogens: oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, polonium; and the four halogens: fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine\n\u24c1\u2009 Anion-only elements are confined to oxygen and fluorine.", "St. John's Rugby Football Club\n\nThe St. John's Rugby Football Club was a Canadian football team in Winnipeg, Manitoba, formed in October 1887, that played in the Manitoba Rugby Football Union and Western Canada Rugby Football Union between 1892 and 1932.

Formal diplomatic relations between two states are non-existent as Georgia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state.\nHistory.\nThe Foreign Minister of Georgia, David Bakradze, said on 18 February 2008 that Tbilisi would not recognise Kosovo's independence, adding: \"I think everyone in Georgia, regardless of political orientation, is unanimous on this\". On 29 March 2008 the prime minister, Lado Gurgenidze, gave a recorded interview in Estonia, in which he clearly said in English that as Georgia's friends have recognised Kosovo, it is only natural that eventually Georgia will do likewise. The printed publication of the interview elicited demands by the opposition to impeach him, and the government spokesman stated that the prime minister was misinterpreted, after which the Estonian paper \"Postimees\", which conducted and printed the interview, released the audio to the world. On 9 May 2008 President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, said \"We are saying loud and clear that we have never planned to recognize Kosovo. Nor do we plan to do so in the future. The way out of the situation that has been chosen is not the best one. The Serbs should have been given more time for negotiations. The solution for Kosovo was a hasty one\".\nReferences.\nGeorgian Kosovar Relations: Expanded Article\nHistory of Relations\nIn general, analyzing the current relations between Georgia and Kosovo one can speak about historical, political and geopolitical aspects. Since the time Kosovo announced its independence from Serbia in 2008 Georgia has not recognized Kosovo as an independent state. Thus, Georgian government\u2019s position coincides with Georgian national interest mainly in question of territorial integrity being worried by Georgian authorities more and more due to a number of conflicts with its own breakaway territories \u2013 Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\nIn February 18, 2008, the Foreign Minister of Georgia, David Bakradze gave assurance that Tbilisi would not recognize Kosovo independence. He noted that this was the sentiment on both sides of Georgia\u2019s political divide, due to concerns over precedent that could lead to the encouragement of secessionist activity within its borders\nHowever, during an interview in Estonia in March of 2008, Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze intimated a shift, which stated that as Georgia\u2019s friends recognized Kosovo, Georgia might follow suit. Nevertheless, this simple statement caused uproar within the country\u2019s borders, and the government has since in an attempt to PIN the premier down, established that he had been misunderstood. This to my mind gave an evidence of the prowess of the issue under Georgian political agenda and its discursive construction as sensitive.\nIn May 2008 Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili again stating Georgian stance not to recognize Kosovo, was highly critical of international communities\u2019 \u2018precipitous\u2019 approach to the recognition of Kosovo\u2019s independence. Speaking to the House of Commons on Tuesday, he said that Serbia should have been granted more time for negotiations and argued that such decisions might have adverse effects on territories all over the world.\nGeopolitical Context\nSuch non-recognition is thus closely related to Georgia\u2019s own geographic context. After the Russo-Georgian war in 2008, Russia began to recognize the independence of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the same way as Kosovo. Russia said that the Kosovo case initiated the process of secession around the whole world which allegation is negated by Georgia and western countries. This dynamic provides a window into the more global struggle, outlined in the introduction, which is un/ruling by Russia over its neighbors, and the West over its own territories.\nComparative Perspectives\nAlthough Georgia is in company of these non-recognizing states in relation to Kosovo, its position is quite complicated owing to its internal ethno-territorial unrest. Serbia still supports Kosovo like Russia supported Crimea, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. On the other hand, Georgia regards Kosovo\u2019s independence as the exceptional phenomena resulted from the given circumstances of the Balkan Wars instead of the secessionist trends\nInternational Implications\nPressures beyond both states contribute to the nature of Kosovo-Georgia relations. The United States and the European Union have endorsed Kosovo\u2019s claim of independence but denied the same to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. These and other sources of this perceived double-standard are the subject of disagreement in international relations. On the other hand, Russian recognition and support for Georgian separatist areas it viewed as a directly inverse move to western interventions in Balkans.\nConclusion\nCurrent interactions between Georgian and Kosovar states and societies are influenced by historical precedent, regional geopolitics, and conflict over legal paradigms it is necessary. Still, the two productions do not show much direct diplomacy between the two entities but raise themes of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination most of which is problematic in the current world\u2019s political divide.", "Michael Leong\n\nMichael Patrick Leong (born 18 March 1986) is a Solomon Islands former professional tennis player.

The first church built here, titled \"Santa Lucia fuori le mura\", was founded atop or among the ruins of a pagan temple dedicated to Jove. When this church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1075, a church dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation was built. Sometime in the 13th century, the Carmelite Fathers took possession and added a large adjacent convent. The church was damaged severely during the 1693 Sicily earthquake and rebuilt in the present form by 1729. This church was elevated to minor basilica in 1988. The adjacent convent has been a barracks since the 19th-century.\nLegend holds the church was once the first burial place for Saint Agatha, but in addition, the area during the Ancient Roman era served as a necropolis. Inside the adjacent convent are the stone remnants of an Ancient Roman tomb, which some authors had called the \"Tomb of Stesichorus.\"\nThe exterior facade is notable for the giant order of columns, with a design attributed to Francesco Battaglia. Behind the niche with the statue of the Virgin of the Carmine at the superior tympanum are a series of 19th-century bells. A market place is held in the piazza outside the church.\nThe interior has a number of large altarpieces, and funereal monuments, and a wooden icon meant to depict St Agatha but modeled after an aristocratic donor to the church, Rosalia Petruso Grimaldi, who was murdered in 1784 by her jealous husband.

Notable people with the surname include:", "Soletta 750\n\nThe Soletta 750 is the first ever Swiss-built concept car. It was also the first car both designed and built in Switzerland in the post-World War II (WWII) period. The Soletta 750 debuted in 1956. Only one was ever made, primarily to demonstrate a new type of automobile suspension system.\nHistory.\nWilly Ernst Salzmann was an engineer and graduate of the \"Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich\" (ETH Zurich \u2014 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich). While still a student he designed a sophisticated three-wheel vehicle. After graduating he ran his own engineering design company, the \"Ingenieurbureau f\u00fcr Fahrzeugbau\" (Engineering Office for Vehicle Construction), based in Solothurn, Switzerland. He made a name for himself and his company by designing equipment for Ford and Ferguson tractors.\nSalzmann designed a new type of rear automobile suspension system called the Zweigelenk-Elastikachse Salzmann (Salzmann two-joint elastic axle). Key features of the suspension were a fixed or semi-fixed differential with swing axle half-shafts and coil springs, with the half-shafts connected by a transverse member slung under the differential and attached to the shafts with rubber springs.\nSalzmann wanted to display his new suspension at the Geneva Motor Show but was told that the main hall was reserved for complete cars, and that he would be restricted to the space for parts and accessories. Salzmann decided to build a car around his new suspension design so that it could appear in the main hall.\nWhile some sources say that the car was built in just six weeks, others point out that its appearance at Geneva was announced in 1955, indicating that the design work likely started much earlier.\nThe body was manufactured by the Carrosserie Hess in Bellach.\n\"Soletta\" is the Italian name for the town of Solothurn.\nThe Soletta 750 debuted at the 1956 Geneva Motor Show. It appeared later that same year at the Paris Motor Show with revised bodywork. The reaction of the international press to the car was surprised but generally positive. The Soletta 750 was viewed by Sir Alec Issigonis, future designer of the Mini, at the 1956 Paris Show. He remarked that there was a market for four-place concepts like the Soletta 750.\nRenault, Alfa Romeo, and a government agency in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) all expressed interest in the project, but this did not lead to series production.\nThe Soletta 750 appeared at a special exhibition in Wangen an der Aare in 2009. In 2018 the car again appeared at the Geneva Motor Show as part of the \"Le Retour du Futur\" (The Return of the Future) exhibit. The car is now owned by the Swiss Car Register and was displayed at the Pantheon Basel in Muttenz and in 2020 at the Verkehrshaus Luzern. Since November 2023 the car is displayed at the \"Enter Technikwelt Solothurn\" in Derendingen SO.\nSalzmann later designed a compact four cylinder \"X-Boxer\" engine meant for the car. In the following years he developed another innovative engine with combined piston and connecting rods and continued to experiment with microcars into the 1990s.\nFeatures.\nThe Soletta 750 is a two-door, four-seat sedan. Due to its small size, it can be considered a subcompact car, or even a microcar. \nMuch of the body is plastic, while the door skins are steel. To simplify production and reduce costs, complementary body panels, such as the doors on the right and left, the front \"grille\" and rear \"tailgate\" covers, and diagonally opposite fenders, are interchangeable. This symmetry means that the driver's side door is hinged on the B-pillar and opens towards the back of the car, while the passenger's side door is hinged on the A-pillar and opens towards the front.\nThe Soletta 750 is built on a platform chassis with an upper steel tube framework. The front suspension is independent with upper and lower A-arms and coil springs. Some parts are said to be from the Renault 4, with the front suspension and the chassis possibly coming from the French car.\nThe engine is an air cooled flat-twin displacing a little under 750\u00a0cc. It was built by Condor-Werke AG of Courfaivre, who used it in their shaft-driven A750 military motorcycle, a large displacement version of the A580 model whose design was strongly influenced by German bikes from makes such as BMW and Zundapp.\nThis former motorcycle engine is located under the rear seat and drives the rear wheels via a three-speed gearbox. Engine, transmission, and differential together form a single powertrain swing-arm assembly meant to improve ride quality and simplify maintenance.", "Only Honest on the Weekend\n\nOnly Honest on the Weekend is the debut studio album by English singer Becky Hill, released on 27 August 2021 through Eko and Polydor Records.

Kheraj also summarised the album as \"disposable\" and a \"conveyor belt of blandness\" that makes one wonder why Hill \"bothered to make\" it as \"[p]erhaps after waiting nearly a decade to be allowed to release an album, Hill's enthusiasm had just run dry\". Conversely, \"Clash\"s Caitlin Sibthorpe scored the album seven out of 10, calling it an \"unstoppable pop banger\" with \"sensational guest stars\" and \"faultless production\" that make it \"even more tantalizing\". Sibthorpe felt that \"the versatility of the album will produce mass adoration\". Neil McCormick for \"The Telegraph\" awarded the album three stars out of five and found that while Hill \"sings beautifully and has energy to burn\", \"this is more like a pop data dump than a crafted debut album\".\nCommercial performance.\n\"Only Honest on the Weekend\" debuted at number seven on the UK Album Charts and stayed in the top 100 for an initial 11 weeks. The album, following its deluxe edition release, re-entered the chart in March 2022 at number 15 and returned to its peak position in August 2022 following Hill's performance at the final of the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 championship.

The show features 184 interviews with creatives, actors and directors including Norman Lear, Mel Brooks, Yvette Lee Bowser, Marta Kauffman, and Carl Reiner (in his last recorded interview). The series follows a similar format of the CNN Original Series \"The History of Comedy\".\nThe series takes an expansive view of what can be considered a sitcom; it includes traditional programs shot with multiple cameras in front of a live audience like \"I Love Lucy\" as well as modern single camera programs like \"Fleabag\". The decision about which programs to include, according to series producer Bill Carter, came down to: \"If the overarching purpose of the show is to make you laugh, it can be considered a sitcom. And in almost all cases, the shows are half-hours rather than hours.\"\nProduction.\n\"The series uses the same team \u2014 executive producer John Ealer and former New York Times media writer Bill Carter \u2014 that recently created CNN's six-part \"The Story of Late Night\".\nThey first had to first decide how to define a sitcom, which originally was three cameras on a soundstage before a live studio audience and a laugh track. But in recent years, comedies such as \"The Office\" and \"Modern Family\" dispensed with the laugh track and audience. \"We created a sniff test,\" Ealer said. \"Does it feel like a sitcom? \"Insecure\" is not the same as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" Yet they both represent how comedy opened up the viewpoints of Americans in profoundly funny ways.\" Carter noted that \"M*A*S*H\" was considered a groundbreaking comedy despite heavy doses of drama. \"If you started to eliminate shows because they had a lot of drama, you'd get rid of a lot of great comedy,\" he said.\n\"History of the Sitcom\" began production just before the pandemic and used the rest of the year to interview a whopping 184 people for the series, including some of the biggest living luminaries of the sitcom world, from Ted Danson to Tina Fey. Ealer said they strategically began lining up interviews of the older luminaries first and fortunately did so right before the pandemic.\"\nBefore each episode, there is a 10-second intro of the show, which parodies the title cards of famous sitcoms including \"I Love Lucy, Bewitched, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Home Improvement, Happy Days, Living Single, M*A*S*H, Seinfeld, Gilligan's Island, Fresh Off the Boat, Cheers, Frasier, Black-ish.

In 1871, the firm became Cromwell, Steele &amp; Conlan. He then gave most of his law practice to his partners and focused on insurance. After the firm was dissolved in 1873, he formed a banking partnership with J. F. Morse called W. H. Steele &amp; Co. The firm was renamed Steele &amp; Morse in 1874. In 1876, he resumed his law practice, practicing on his own.\nIn 1878, Steele was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Republican, representing the Oswego County 3rd District. He served in the Assembly in 1879, 1880, and 1881. In 1882, he ended his insurance business and took over the hardware business E. Dixon &amp; Co., renaming the business W. H. Steele &amp; Co. In 1887, he moved to Pulaski. In 1889, he settled in Oswego. He bought a store and farm in Altmar in 1897, although he continued to live in Oswego. He was a delegate and Second Vice President of the 1894 New York State Constitutional Convention. He worked on the revising and indexing the Convention's records, a task that occupied him until 1899 and produced five printed volumes with a total of six thousand pages. In 1896 and 1897, he assisted Commissioner Lyman organize the state's new Excise Department.\nSteele was active in the Freemasons, organizing a lodge for them in Schagticoke. He also organized the first Order of the Eastern Star lodge outside of New York City. He was a Congregationalist. In 1866, he married Augusta Burnhans of Delhi.

Leonard was the first radiologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, founded the Philadelphia Roentgen Ray Society, and served as president of the American Roentgen Ray Society in 1904\u20131905. He was known as one of the foremost experts in urological X-ray diagnosis, and he was the first American physician to demonstrate kidney stone disease with X-rays.\nA native of Massachusetts, Leonard completed bachelor's degrees at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University, then returned to Penn for medical school. As a student, he was interested in photography, and after going to Europe to work in science laboratories, he developed an interest in photomicrography. Leonard captured microscopic images that furthered the understanding of the life cycles of microorganisms.\nLeonard was associated with University Hospital from the mid-1890s to 1902. He was first named an assistant instructor in clinical surgery under J. William White, and then he ran the hospital's X-ray service, which seemed to combine his interests in photography and surgical problems. While he was at Penn, Leonard opened a private office for taking X-rays. After he left the medical school, he devoted his time to this private practice as well as to writing about radiology and representing the specialty nationally and internationally at medical conferences.\nLike many of the pioneers in radiography, Leonard suffered from adverse effects of radiation exposure before the causes of these problems were fully understood. During his first several years of X-ray work, he believed that X-ray burns resulted from ungrounded electrical current, so he did not take precautions to shield his body from radiation. Before he died of radiation-induced cancer, Leonard had multiple operations, including the amputation of his entire right arm.\nEarly life.\nLeonard was born on December 29, 1861, in Easthampton, Massachusetts, to Moses and Harriet () Leonard. He had two siblings; his brother, Frederick M. Leonard, became a prominent Philadelphia attorney. The family could trace its ancestry back to John Leonard, who left England in 1632 to settle in Springfield, Massachusetts, and to William Brewster, who came to the U.S. on the \"Mayflower\". Another of their forebears, Elijah Leonard, fought in the American Revolutionary War.\nLeonard grew up in Philadelphia, and he attended Rittenhouse Academy. He then earned bachelor's degrees at the University of Pennsylvania (1885) and Harvard University (1886). He received a medical degree from Penn in 1889, then went to Europe to observe some laboratory techniques. During his studies, Leonard was interested in photography and served as a model for Eadweard Muybridge's photographic study of human motion called \"Man Running\".\nCareer.\nEarly work at Penn.\nLeonard took a position as an assistant instructor of clinical surgery at Penn, where he worked under surgeon J. William White. The university awarded him a Master of Arts in 1892 while he was already a faculty member. When Penn's William Pepper Clinical Laboratory opened in 1895, Leonard began conducting his laboratory work there. He became interested in photomicrography, which is the acquisition of photographic images from microscopes. He devised an electric lens-shutter that allowed him to capture microorganisms in different phases of their life cycles.\nIn 1895, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen produced the first X-rays. Early on, X-rays were used mostly for surgical applications. Leonard already had interests in surgery and photography, so he was fascinated by the potential for X-rays. A Philadelphia physicist named Arthur Willis Goodspeed set up a radiography laboratory near University Hospital, and the hospital initially sent its patients there for X-rays, but it became impractical to transport a patient to this facility each time a study was required. In September 1896, Leonard began running a hospital-wide X-ray service out of the Pepper Laboratory. White had a separate X-ray laboratory, but it was used almost solely for teaching purposes.\nWhile Leonard's X-ray apparatus in the Pepper Laboratory was on the grounds of University Hospital, it still proved impractical to transport hospitalized patients there. Leonard's X-ray equipment was relocated in late 1897 to the Agnew Memorial Pavilion, a brand new wing of the hospital, but the decision to move it there came after the new wing was fully designed. Leonard had a single X-ray exam room near the surgical dispensary, and the darkroom was so small that no visitors or students could observe Leonard as he developed the X-ray plates. Leonard imaged 141 hospital patients in 1901, and the most common studies were of the abdomen and pelvis; the exposure time for each patient could be as long as several minutes.\nLeonard's influence in radiology quickly extended beyond University Hospital. In 1899, he was approached by Philadelphia General Hospital and asked to help a young physician, George E. Pfahler, with setting up an X-ray service at that hospital. Leonard advised Pfahler on the types of equipment to install, including a self-regulating X-ray tube that Leonard had success with from the Philadelphia-based James W. Queen &amp; Company. Around this time, Leonard began conducting research and writing more extensively. He became interested in using X-rays to diagnose fractures and to locate foreign bodies in the eye.\nLater career and shift to private practice.\nDuring his time at Penn, Leonard also opened a private X-ray office in Philadelphia's Center City, and he became the director of the X-ray laboratories at Philadelphia Polyclinic and Methodist Episcopal Hospital. Leonard was the first American physician to identify kidney stones on an X-ray. While he continued to do general X-ray work, he gained a wide reputation for his ability to diagnose kidney stones.\nLeonard used an X-ray system consisting of accumulators and a Ruhmkorff coil with a low-voltage primary winding that excited a self-regulating X-ray tube. In 1936, radiologist Percy Brown wrote that Leonard's intricate setup \"was a source of great interest and some surprise to his contemporaries, but will amaze radiologists of a later generation who now read of them for the first time.\" Leonard examined more than 300 patients for kidney stones with this technique, and he said he had an error rate of three percent. He knew of 45 patients who had been taken to surgery despite no X-ray evidence of kidney stones, and he said that surgeons did not find kidney stones in any of those patients. Leonard influenced the surgical management of ureteral stones by showing that the patient was usually able to pass small stones in this area by themselves.\nLeonard was one of the first physicians to work with stereo-roentgenography, which used stereoscopy to produce three-dimensional X-ray images that allowed physicians to better determine the anatomic relationships between organs. Leonard used the technique to visualize a patient's small intestine. He may have been the first American radiologist to define a dosage unit for radiation, though it was not possible to measure dosage at that point. Commenting on the possibility of employing radiation therapy, he said that physicians needed to be able to deliver a controlled dose, and the unit should be defined as \"the unit quantity of electricity passing across a unit gap in unit time under the influences of radiation at unit distance under standard conditions of barometer and temperature.\"\nLeonard left Penn in 1902. Two things likely contributed to this decision: a busy schedule of other professional responsibilities and the onset of disabling tissue injuries from radiation exposure. He was heavily involved in the American Roentgen Ray Society, serving as its president for 1904\u20131905. He hosted a number of physicians at his office in 1905 to discuss their interest in radiology. This group became the Philadelphia Roentgen Ray Society, and Leonard was the organization's secretary until he died. He served as the American Medical Association (AMA) delegate to several international conferences on radiology, and he was an editor or associate editor for several medical journals.\nPersonal life.\nLeonard married Ruth Hodgson, and they had a daughter named Catherine Henrietta Lawson Leonard. Catherine married James Bennett Hance, a member of the Indian Medical Service, in Oxford in 1916. In his leisure time, Leonard enjoyed visiting the woods in Canada.\nX-ray injuries.\nIn the earliest days of X-rays, a radiographer had to take an image of his own hands to test the X-ray tube before each patient image was taken. The fragile X-ray equipment had to be positioned precisely, and this required that the radiographer's face, hands and arms were in close proximity to the X-ray beam during these lengthy examinations. In the era before radiation safety was well understood, many X-ray pioneers suffered adverse effects from radiation overexposure. Leonard developed X-ray burns and then radiation-induced cancer that started in a finger and eventually traveled up the entire arm and to other parts of his body. Historian Rebecca Herzig wrote that the pain from Leonard's radiation injuries \"seems merely to have intensified his fascination with the ray\"; she wrote that the ten-year period of Leonard's most productive X-ray research corresponded to a decade of increasing physical suffering.\nLeonard mentioned X-ray burns in a presentation before the AMA in 1897. At that time, he shared the belief of many physicians that X-ray burns were caused by a lack of grounding of the electrical current from the apparatus. He laid an aluminum sheet between the patient and the X-ray tube and had a grounding wire that ran from the aluminum down to the floor. In an 1898 article in the \"New York Medical Journal\", Leonard described a patient with inoperable cancer who underwent 25-minute X-ray exposures every day for three weeks. The surrounding areas were shielded with the aluminum sheet, and the patient sustained no X-ray burns (and received no therapeutic benefit). This strengthened Leonard's belief that X-rays themselves were not the cause of what were known as X-ray burns.\nLeonard was so convinced of his electrical current explanation that for several years he did not take any precautions to shield his hands from radiation. The problems with Leonard's hands worsened, and an already skeptical public most likely began to notice the injuries to his skin. At one point, still not fully aware of the risks of radiation and intrigued by the possibility of radiation therapy, Leonard purposely applied an intense dose of radiation to his hand. He had hoped that the radiation would kill any cancer cells and help him avoid further surgery or amputations. After this incident, the finger required amputation.\nA 1903 presentation showed that Leonard had become concerned about the X-ray beams themselves rather than the associated electrical current. He told attendees at that year's ARRS meeting that he had devised a lead-lined box that surrounded the X-ray tube in an attempt to prevent X-rays from scattering about the exam room.\nDeath and legacy.\nDuring the final months of his life, Leonard spent much of his time collaborating with Austrian radiologist Guido Holzknecht on a review of radiography in gastrointestinal conditions that was to be read at the August 1913 meeting of the Section of Radiology of the International Congress of Medicine. In spite of significant pain and suffering, Leonard read through literature in English, French and German in preparing the work. A memorial issue of the \"American Journal of Roentgenology\" said that Leonard was known for bearing his illness in secret.\nIn the summer of 1913, Leonard went to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he was hoping that the sea air would improve his health. He became confined to bed soon after he arrived in Atlantic City, and he died there on September 22, 1913. He had undergone amputation of his hand several years earlier, and his entire arm was amputated a few months before he died.\nThe American Roentgen Ray Society established the Charles Lester Leonard Prize to recognize outstanding contributions to X-ray technology.

He belonged to a group of natural philosophers who rejected appeals to the supernatural and occult to explain phenomena. He is thought to have influenced Galileo and Borro's ideas were published in dialogue form in a book on tides \"Dialogo del flusso e reflusso del mare\" (1561). Another book by Borro was on moving bodies, \"De motu gravium et levium\" (1575). He also authored some manuscripts including \"Multae sunt nostrarum ignorationum causae.\"\nBorro was born in Arezzo to Mariano and was educated at Padua. A patron of his was Cardinal Giovanni Salviati and after his death he held a chair in philosophy at Pisa with colleagues like Selvaggio Ghettini. Like several other Tuscan philosophers of the period including Andrea Cesalpino and Francesco Buonamici he rejected the use of theology to explain natural phenomena. He was brought into the heresy trial of Pietro Carnesecchi in 1567 and during the Roman inquisition of 1582 but was cleared by influence from Pope Gregory XIII. He taught philosophy at the University of Pisa during Galileo's student days. Two of the books that Borro wrote were in Galileo's library and may have influenced his writings, as there is an explicit citation to Borro's 1575 book. Borro himself drew his ideas from Greek and Arab thinkers and did not cite any theological writings. He claimed that God was only involved in conceiving and loving himself and not bothered by earthly or human matters. His explanation of the tides was based on the idea that the moon heated and caused an expansion of the water. He also emphasized the use of experiments in addition to experience as methods for gaining knowledge. He used the phrase \"periculum facere\" for his trials such as those that involved simultaneously dropping a piece of wood and an equal weight of lead from a height to examine which fell first.

The films focus on a variety of topics, but all depict life in Zhangzhuangcun (translated as Long Bow Village), a village in the Shanxi province of the People's Republic of China often known as the topic of the book \"Fanshen\" by Carma Hinton's father, William H. Hinton. Many of the people mentioned or interviewed for \"Fanshen\" appear in the films.\nBackground.\nAlthough her father had worked extensively with the villagers of Long Bow, Carma Hinton did not have the idea of making films about the village until she witnessed villagers performing on stilts in 1977. Afterwards, she worked with Richard Gordon to make a 28-minute film titled \"Stilt Dancers of Long Bow Village\" in collaboration with GEO magazine. The reception to this film inspired further interest in filming the villagers, leading to the inception of the trilogy. The topics of each part of the trilogy were chosen, in part, based on the topics of interviews with the subject of the third film, Dr. Shen Fasheng.\nFilms.\nNarration throughout the films is kept to a minimum, with emphasis placed on the testimony of people living in the village. The films were produced over three years, with the chronological production order being \"Small Happiness\" (1984), \"All Under Heaven\" (1985), and \"To Taste 100 Herbs\" (1986).\n\"Part One: All Under Heaven\".\nThe first film discusses the religious and cultural traditions of the community in Long Bow Village, including a funeral, a country fair, and an open air opera performance. Although nominally about religion and culture, large parts of the film consist of interviews where village residents discuss the transition from collective farming to individual farming in China and the effects on the community. Long Bow prospered under collective management, which led to resistance when economic reforms dismantled the system. Although villagers agree the old system had problems with motivation (with workers getting paid merely for showing up to work), the new system creates problems as collectively purchased farming equipment becomes useless on small, privately owned plots. In this way, agriculture also becomes feminized, as women are left to tend to their husband's fields while the men take higher paying jobs. A vegetable farming entrepreneur in the village is one of the only people happy about the changes, stating that \"everyone has to make some money- I'll make more and they'll make less.\" Another man, more bitter over the prospects, remarks that \"When times get difficult, people will think of the collective and Chairman Mao.\" The resurgence in private personal wealth in the village has led to more lavish weddings, funerals, and festivals, many of which were prohibited in their traditional forms during the cultural revolution, and all are shown in the film.\n\"Part Two: Small Happiness\".\nThe second film focuses on the advances and limitations of women's rights in China after the cultural revolution, including interviews with village women who discuss topics such as birth control and customs, the criminalization of foot binding, marriage, and love.\nThe film is named for a village proverb that reflects gender roles: \"To give birth to a boy is considered a big happiness. To give birth to a girl is a small happiness.\" The older women of the village reflect on the old customs such as foot binding as \"horrors of another world,\" with one explaining how she was forced to smother her own baby due to famine pre-revolution. However, gender roles are not yet equal, with a woman testifying that she had to stop driving a tractor because it was not considered \"convenient\" for men and women to work together. Furthermore, government birth control, despite being more lenient in rural areas, affects women deeply, who are socially pressured to give birth to sons over daughters. A focal point of the film is a marriage scene, in which the bride begrudgingly takes part in a ceremony to honor the groom's ancestors, being heckled by his friends and family for the duration.\n\"Part Three: To Taste 100 Herbs\".\nIn contrast to the first two films, the third film focuses largely on one individual: Dr. Shen Fasheng, a Catholic doctor who practices traditional Chinese medicine as well as Western medical practices. Although Dr. Shen is a minority in the village as a practicing Christian, he is considered an important member of the community by other villagers and garners respect. In addition to interviews regarding Catholicism, medical ethics, rural health care, and traditional medicine, the film also includes scenes of Christian prayer services. Dr. Shen also in part served as the inspiration for the trilogy as a whole, having helped solidify the focus of the films on religion, family, and medicine.\nReception.\nThe film trilogy was well received by scholars in Asian studies and has become a common classroom film, especially when shown after assigned readings of \"Fanshen\" and \"Shenfan\", as many people mentioned in Hilton's works are depicted and interviewed in the films.\nDue to the significant emphasis placed on oral testimony, the film trilogy has been the subject of interest and review by oral historians.", "Alice Duncan-Kemp\n\nAlice Monkton Duncan-Kemp (1901\u20131988) was an Australian writer and Indigenous rights activist.\nBiography.\nBorn on 3 June 1901 at Charleville, Queensland, Duncan-Kemp was the daughter of William and Laura Duncan (n\u00e9e Davis).

It was edited by Gary Westfahl and consists of three volumes of 200 entries each. The first two volumes contain entries organized by themes, such as \"Aliens in Space\", \"Asia\" or \"Rats and Mice\", while the third volume lists works such as novels and films which are considered defining for the science fiction and fantasy genres.\nThe reviews of the work were mixed, with most reviewers finding this encyclopedia to be a commendable effort, but criticizing the work for being not comprehensive enough yet overpriced (at $349.95).\nContents.\nThe scope of \"The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy\" was defined early on as 600 entries written by a number of different authors, ranging from established specialists to doctoral students. It consists of three volumes of 200 entries each, with the first two containing entries on themes, and the last one focusing on selected novels, films, and television series. Each entry is about 800 words long. Themes range from expected \"Aliens in Space\" or \"Dragons\", less expected ones such as \"Food and Drink\" or \"Rats and Mice\", to ones criticized by some reviewers as likely unnecessary, such as \"Christmas\" or \"Eschatology\".\nReception.\nShortly after its release, in 2005, Donald M. Hassler reviewed \"The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy\" for \"Extrapolation\". He praised the aesthetics of the work, noting that the set is \"beautifully bound in boards that look like pulp magazine covers\". He found the volumes \"useful and fun\" but also \"idiosyncratic\" when it comes to the selection of the topics, concluding that despite professed consultation with other experts over the contents \"certain themes rather than others have haunted Westfahl himself\". He observed that the last volume, focusing on works, seems to be biased towards 19th century classics, noting the omission of entries on more recent works such as \"Dhalgren\", \"Mission of Gravity\", \"The End of Eternity\", or \"The Gods Themselves\". With the acknowledgement that the editors subjective tastes significantly influenced the selection of topics, he concluded that the work is one of the \"stars in the expanding university of science fiction studies\".\nAaron Parrett, reviewing this work for the \"Science Fiction Studies\" in 2006, suggested that it is too limited in scope, and \"reflects the idiosyncratic state\" of its editor, criticizing the choice of the term encyclopedia in the book's name as misleading. He blamed Greenwood's editorial board for \"thwarting a solid survey of a literary field\" by limiting this project to 600 entries, particularly given that the book already combines two genres (science fiction and fantasy). With regards to the actual contents, he further criticized the work as lacking many entries he perceives as crucial (ex. \"Amazing Stories\", \"Astounding Stories\". \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", \"Jurassic Park\", \"Minority Report\", \"THX 1138\", \"Twin Peaks\"), while having unnecessary entries on topics such as \"Christianity\" or \"Christmas\". For the existing entries he argues many are likewise not comprehensive, for example pointing that the entry on \"The Simpsons\" fails to mention the show's resident space aliens, Kang and Kodos. He further observed that the book is mostly focused on fantasy, rather than science fiction, and calls the entire project a \"sampler\" of the relevant literary canon rather than a proper encyclopedia. He did note that \"there is plenty here to enjoy and appreciate\", highlighting a number of \"delightful\" entries, and concluded by resigning himself to the fact that by default, any encyclopedic project \"that aims for anything less [than everything] will be inevitably limited in scope\".\nWill Slocombe, reviewing this encyclopedia for \"\" the same year, wrote that the project is too ambitious for its limited size, and pointed out that the allocation of roughly the same word count to all entries is not fair for more complex topics (comparing, for example, entries on \"Aliens in Space\" to \"Rats and Mice\"), which therefore often fail \"to deliver enough depth\". Along those lines, he observed that the editorial choice not to have entries on authors, while justifiable, further reinforces the lack of comprehensiveness visible this encyclopedia. He nonetheless acknowledged that \"the general quality of the entries is good\", and in particular praised \"the geographically-themed articles\" about different parts of the world, such as \"Asia\" or \"South Pacific\", as well as those on niche topics, such as the \"Rats and Mice\", although he also cautioned that their inclusion can make the work \"too ephemeral\" on occasion. He concluded that the cost of the work is also likely too prohibitive for most readers, but found the work a \"useful inclusion in a library reference section\", calling the work \"not entirely successful but... an interesting and engaging attempt\".\nAlso in 2006, Keith M.C. O'Sullivan reviewed the work for the \"Reference Reviews\". He observed that as a result of trying to cover both science fiction and fantasy genres, the encyclopedia is \"a little overreaching\". He found the overall organization of this work \"quite impressive\", although he found the lack of consistency between entries by different authors unfortunate, if expected. The entries themselves he found generally \"well researched\", although he also noted that there are occasional \"surprising oversights\", and several weaker entries do little but summarize the plot of the works described. He observed that unfortunately due the space and organizational limits, some shorter but nonetheless important works have been omitted from the 200 entries of canon; here he lists omissions such as \"The Stone Tape,\" \"I Sing the Body Electric\", \"Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon\", \"Being John Malkovich\", and the entirety of works of H. P. Lovecraft. He concluded that the \"hefty price\" of the work makes the work unlikely to be of use to individual readers outside of libraries, and ended by writing that \"with many reservations, it is a brave, well-researched and substantial endeavour, and a useful if not perfect reference tool\".\nSteven J. Corvi reviewing the \"Greenwood Encyclopedia\" for \"The Journal of Popular Culture\" in 2007 likewise noted the book is overpriced (at $349.95) and therefore is not likely to be easily accessible to most casual readers. Second, he criticized the work's \"cumbersome organization\", noting that as expected from this type of work with a multitude of co-authors, \"entries vary in usefulness and quality\". Additionally, he observed that the work also misses some \"essential\" entries, particularly in the realm of influential films. Nonetheless, he concluded that \"these faults do not offset the usefulness of this work\", and that it is \"an essential tool for students writing thematic essays\", and teachers planning relevant lessons. He also noted that the very existence of this encyclopedia can help \"create an intellectual legitimacy\" for those genres.\nThe most common criticism that most reviewers independently noted is that many entries introduce topics \u2013 themes, works, people (ex. Chinua Achebe) \u2013 that seem important and that the readers may want to research further, but that are just mentioned in passing and have no independent entries.", "Listed buildings in Parlington\n\nParlington is a civil parish in the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

He gained recognition in the 1980s as a member of the \"Allusive Abstractionists,\" an informal group of Chicago painters, whose individual forms of organic abstraction embraced evocative imagery and metaphor, counter to the dominant minimalist mode. He is most known for paintings that critics describe as metaphysical and visionary, which move fluidly between abstraction and representation, personalized symbolism taking organic and geometric forms, and chaos and order. They are often characterized by bright patterns of dotted lines and dashes, enigmatic spatial fields, and an illuminated quality. In 2010, critic James Yood wrote that Loving's work \"mull[ed] over the possibilities of pattern and representation, of narrative and allegory\" to attain a kind of wisdom, transcendence and acknowledgement of universals, \"seeking understanding of self within the poetics of the physical world.\"\nLoving's art has been exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York, Block Museum of Art, Hyde Park Art Center and Brauer Museum of Art. His work belongs to the public collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and Smart Museum of Art, among others.\nLife and career.\nRichard Maris Loving was born in Vienna, Austria in 1924. His parents, Pierre and Faith Loving, were American writers who lived in Europe and socialized in 1920s artistic circles. After his family moved to New York City in 1929, Loving studied art at Bard College, The New School for Social Research and the Art Students League in the latter 1940s, interrupted by a stint in the army. In 1945, he married Frances Brando, a fellow artist, and later, naturalist and teacher, who was the sister of actors Marlon Brando and Jocelyn Brando. They lived in Hell's Kitchen in the late-1940s, where Frances introduced Loving to family friend Wally Cox, then a silversmith with a jewelry shop and an aspiring comedic actor. Loving learned the craft of enameling from Cox, which he supplemented by studying Limoges enamels at city museums; as Cox's entertainment career advanced, he turned over management of his shop to Loving.\nIn 1953, the Lovings left Manhattan for the Brando family's farm, Pennypoke, near Mundelein, Illinois. Loving converted the property's barn and out-buildings into a family-operated jewelry workshop and art studio, including a large kiln that he built in order to produce large-scale enamel artworks. During that time, Loving exhibited at the Bloomington Art Association (1957) and Lawrence College (1963), and in the exhibition, \"Enamels\" (Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York, 1959), developing what art historian Franz Schulze later called \" a modest, static local reputation in craft circles.\"\nBy the late 1960s, Loving had largely left the Brando farm, eventually divorcing Frances. He settled in a Chicago loft, which spurred a significant shift in his art toward drawing and painting, and gradually, abstraction. Schulze cites a 1969 Kovler Gallery exhibition as his \"first important solo show\" in this new phase; Loving also exhibited at Galerie le Chat Bernard (1973), N.A.M.E. Gallery (1977), the St. Paul Art Center (\"Drawings, U.S.A.\" exhibit, 1968) and Art Institute of Chicago (1969 \"Chicago and Vicinity Show\"). He received steadily increasing local and national recognition during the 1970s and 1980s, exhibiting at Roy Boyd Gallery (Chicago and Los Angeles) from 1983 to 1996 and in a ten-year survey at the State of Illinois Art Gallery in 1990. He was also selected to exhibit in the traveling shows \"Abstract, Symbol, Image\" (Hyde Park Art Center, 1984), \"Chicago: Some Other Traditions\" (Madison Art Center, 1984) and \"American Abstraction/Four Currents\" (Louis K. Meisel Gallery, New York, 1985).\nIn his later career, Loving had featured exhibitions at Printworks Gallery (1998, 2003), Jan Cicero Gallery, (2000), the Brauer Museum of Art (2010) and Hyde Park Art Center (2014), and thirty-year reviews at the Evanston Art Center and Art Center in Highland Park (both 2007). Loving died on March 27, 2021, at age 97, in Oak Park, Illinois.\nWork and reception.\nIn \"Arts Magazine\", critic Mary Mathews Gedo characterized Loving as a \"virtually self-taught \u2026 maverick artist\" and late bloomer, who worked representationally during Abstract Expressionism's heyday, retreated from the Manhattan zeitgeist to the country to explore the medieval art of enameling, and in Chicago, turned to abstraction at the height of city's Imagism movement, reaching his mature style and height of productivity and recognition in his upper fifties. \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Alan Artner described Loving's work as evolving from early figuration and representation, to a semi-abstract symbolic discourse from the 1970s to 1990s, to more representational, \"spiritually transcendent\" pictures suggesting cosmic subjects and landscapes in the 2000s.\nEarly work.\nLoving's enamel works on copper often depicted stylized figures set in semi-abstract, primordial landscapes seemingly in flux (e.g., \"Untitled\", 1959). They employ painterly gesture influenced by Abstract Expressionism and bright colors sometimes flecked with gold and silver; the work differs from traditional enameling in its modernist resistance to the medium's inherent decorativeness, achieved through the incorporation of disparate materials such as rough wood, multi-panel formats and large scale. Loving largely discontinued enameling by the end of the 1960s, but writers cite its influence in his later work's use of color, transparency, and geometric divisions within canvasses. \nLoving's new direction was heralded in a 1969 Kovler Gallery show, in which he presented large shaped drawings of fantastical machine forms described as faintly evocative of the Cubist work of Francis Picabia. The drawings led him back to oil painting, yielding a more abstract, subsequent series depicting webs of hard-edged geometric forms disappearing into densely marked backgrounds.\nMature work.\nAfter moving to Chicago, Loving's work began what Franz Schulze called its \"slow ascent toward more ambitious things\"\u2014 a personal style of lyrical abstraction that by the mid-1970s made him \"a figure of recognizable substance on the Chicago art scene.\" He arrived at his mature style during a period when he belonged to the \"Allusive Abstractionists,\" a self-named group of artists that included Miyoko Ito, William Conger and Frank Piatek. They were united by their mutual interest in a form of organic abstraction that\u2014counter to minimalist hard-edged abstraction\u2014embraced real-world referentiality, evocative imagery, metaphor, subjectivity and old master techniques, while exploring contemporary stylistic problems.\nLoving's paintings of this era employed bright patterns of varied, restless line\u2014rippling strokes, dotted lines and dashes he described as \"obsessional mark-making\"\u2014 superimposed on richly colored, mottled color fields (e.g., \"Hathor's Gate Falling Right\", 1977). In these works, the mark served as his central technique, an indicator of time, human intention and energy, as well as a source of rhythm in his compositions. Loving populated his canvasses with free-form, flat diagrammatic shapes (often with bold, electric outlines) and interior borders or portals, creating ambiguous, theatrical spaces that emphasized a contrast between diffuseness and definition (e.g., \"Water Connections\", 1982). Critic Alan Artner has related this work to Georges Seurat's, in terms of its technique and illusion of inner light, while also suggesting that it anticipated the Pattern and Decoration movement and later trends in abstraction evoking aerial, map-like associations.\nAfter an early-1980s trip in which Loving encountered Byzantine mosaics and frescoes, he began incorporating discrete, personalized symbols alluding to sexuality (lips, flowers, fountains, seeds, fireworks) and elemental or microcosmic life (flames, molecules, water, crystals) in his work (e.g., \"Amorosa Tropicalia\", 1983; \"La Source\", 1986; \"Catalysis\", 1991; or \"Parabola\", 1993). Critics such as Charlotte Moser wrote that these works demonstrated a romantic impulse to fix the physical properties of ephemeral sensory impressions, creating a precarious balancing act between flux and order, physics and alchemy. Franz Schulze wrote that the symbols Introduced a surrealist quality into the work, transforming it from \"a cool formalism to an ideographic fantasy, no less cool, but filled with mystery and dark ambiguities.\"\nLater work.\nLoving's later work incorporates more representational imagery, beginning with a 1998 drawing series, \"Dissections,\" and continuing through his paintings of the 2000s, which metaphorically explore visionary and humanist subjects such as fecundity, growth and the irrepressibility of life through brilliantly colored floral and landscape imagery. Initially, these works employed spare, simplified forms such as light fountains and comets (e.g., \"Sympathetic Outpouring\", 2002), painted with his characteristic dashes and sometimes bracketed by otherworldly vertical blazes of light on the sides of the pictures. With paintings such as \"Efflorescense\" (2005), however, he began introducing naturalistically rendered flower (and eventually bird, tree and waterfall) forms. \nThis later work offered an increasingly complex mix of naturalism and enigmatic theatrical spaces that writers say shifted interpretation from literal toward more poetic and mysterious narrative, symbolic and metaphorical frameworks. Paintings such as \"In a Budding Grove\" (2008) or \"Fall and Flowers\" (2009) combine familiar natural settings with formal devices such as unnatural curtain-like bands of light and glowing, curved horizon lines that seem to enclose the landscapes. James Yood compared them to late medieval altarpieces, whose nuance and iconography suggested \"both the physical and metaphysical, the prospect of a dense zone of nature gone wild and also an immersion into the forces\u2014spiritual, chlorophyllic, reproductive, etc.\u2014that in their aggregate comprise the dictates of life.\"\nOther professional activities.\nIn addition to his artmaking, Loving was a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for more than thirty years until his retirement as Professor Emeritus in 2004; he served for several years as chairman of the Painting and Drawing Department. In 1986, he, Frank Piatek and William Conger started the publication \"Chicago/Art/Write\", a self-distributed publication printed with the support of the school, featuring themselves and other artists discussing ideas, often organized around themes, such as \"Regionalism,\" \"Figuration, Representation and Realism\" or \"Difficult Art.\"\nCollections and recognition.\nLoving's work belongs to the public art collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Block Museum of Art, Illinois State Museum, Joslyn Art Museum, Smart Museum of Art and the State of Illinois, as well to corporate, private and university collections. In 1983, he was awarded a Senior Fellowship Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.\nExternal links.", "Sihayo kaXongo\n\nSihayo kaXongo (c. 1824 \u2013 2 July 1883) was a Zulu inKosi (chief). In some contemporary British documents he is referred to as Sirhayo or Sirayo. He was an inDuna (commander) of the iNdabakawombe iButho (social age group and regiment) and supported Cetshwayo in the 1856 Zulu Civil War. Under Cetshwayo, Sihayo was a chief of a key territory on the border with the British Colony of Natal and had a seat on the iBandla (royal council). Sihayo was an Anglophile who wore European clothes and maintained friendly relations with trader James Rorke who lived nearby at Rorke's Drift. By 1864, Sihayo was head of the Qungebe tribe and that year agreed a new western border of the kingdom with Boer leader Marthinus Wessel Pretorius.\nIn 1878 two of Sihayo's wives were found to be cheating, were attacked by Sihayo's family, and fled to Natal. Sihayo's sons and brother launched a cross-border raid which captured and executed them. The British authorities objected and demanded Sihayo's family be handed over to face British justice. Cetshwayo refused and the incident became a casus belli of the 1879 Anglo-Zulu War. Sihayo's kraal was attacked on 12 January and one of his sons killed. Sihayo had taken most of his men to Ulundi to join the royal army. The Zulu defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana, which some of Sihayo's men participated in, but lost the war in July. The Zulu kingdom was broken up after the war and Sihayo lost his land. Sihayo was killed in July 1883 when Ulundi was overrun by the forces of Zibhebhu kaMaphitha during the Third Zulu Civil War.\nEarly life.\nZulu of Sihayo's era did not have English-style surnames, but employed a patrilineal naming system. Thus Sihayo was the son of a man named Xongo. In some contemporary British documents he is referred to as Sirhayo or Sirayo. Years of birth for Zulu of this period are often unknown but can be estimated from their iButho, a grouping of similarly aged men that also functioned as a regiment in times of war; historian John Laband estimates Sihayo's year of birth as 1824. Sihayo became an inDuna (commander) of the iNdabakawombe iButho.\nSihayo was a supporter of Cetshwayo's claim to leadership of the Zulu Kingdom. He supported Cetshwayo in his claim as heir to his father, King Mpande, over that of Cetshwayo's brother Mbulazi during the 1856 civil war. The war culminated in the 2 December 1856 Battle of Ndondakusuka in which Cetshwayo's forces killed Mbulazi, his six other brothers, and the entire 30,000-strong iziGqoza faction. Cetshwayo afterwards seized de facto control of the kingdom, though his father remained nominal king until his death in October 1872. Sihayo seems to have enjoyed a close relationship with Cetshwayo and sat on his iBandla (royal council).\nBy 1864 Sihayo was chief of an important stretch of the kingdom's border with the British Colony of Natal on the Buffalo River, in the south-west of the kingdom. He made his homestead, known by English speakers as a kraal, on the bank of the river near Rorke's Drift. The drift was named after the Irish trader Jim Rorke who had made his home there and was a friend of Sihayo. Sihayo was an Anglophile who wore European clothes rather than traditional Zulu dress. He owned two high-quality, English-made shotguns and was reported to be a good shot at hunting.\nIn 1864 Sihayo was confirmed as head of the Qungebe tribe of Zulu with additional territories adjoining those he already possessed. That same year he met with Boer leader Marthinus Wessel Pretorius to delineate the kingdom's western border with the South African Republic, which had previously been undefined and disputed. The two men jointly erected stone cairns to mark the line.\n1878 border incident.\nIn July 1878 Sihayo was attending the court of Cetshwayo at the Zulu capital, Ulundi, when his son, Mehlokazulu, discovered that Sihayo's Great Wife (and Mehlokazulu's mother) Kaqwelebana and one of Sihayo's junior wives were having affairs with younger lovers. Mehlokazulu conferred with his uncle, Sihayo's brother Zuluhlenga, and three brothers (Bhekuzulu, Nkumbikazulu and Tshekwane) who decided that Kaqwelebana should be executed as was customary in Zulu law for this offence. The men attacked Kaqwelebana's hut and she was wounded, but escaped with the junior wife to Natal.\nSihayo's wives and their lovers sought refuge in the kraals of two Natal border guards. The colonial authorities had long permitted Zulu refugees to settle in Natal but, until 1875, fleeing wives were regarded as chattels and returned to their husbands. The Zulu had crossed into Natal in 1877 to capture a female refugee and the lieutenant-governor of Natal, Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer, had complained to Cetshwayo. The British frequently crossed the border in the other direction in pursuit of fugitives and on at least one occasion Cetshwayo had delivered up such men to the British. Mehlokazulu therefore considered that there would be no serious repercussions if he crossed the border to capture the women. Mehlokazulu, and others in Sihayo's household, crossed the border and seized the junior wife, dragged her back to Zululand and killed her. A few days later some eighty of Sihayo's men, led by the five male family members, did the same to Kaqwelebana, killing her on the Zulu bank of the Buffalo, within sight of Rorke's Drift which had become a Swedish missionary post. In neither case were the women's male lovers or the border guards harmed.\nWhen Bulwer learnt of the cross-border incident he complained to Cetshwayo and demanded that Sihayo's sons and brother be handed over to face justice in Natal. Cetshwayo was of the opinion that the women were guilty under Zulu law and had not been killed on Natal soil so there was no case to answer. Cetshwayo offered payment of \u00a350, likely all the British money he possessed, as a fine which was rejected by Bulwer. Bulwer was considering levying a fine of 5,000 cattle but British High Commissioner for Southern Africa Sir Henry Bartle Frere determined that the incident was a major transgression and could serve as a casus belli for his long-planned invasion and annexation of Zululand. The surrender of Sihayo's brother and sons was one part of Frere's November 1878 ultimatum to the Zulu.\nThe ultimatum was harsh, demanding radical change in the Zulu way of life and social system as well as demanding Sihayo's family face British justice; it was intended by Frere that Cetshwayo would reject it. Cetshwayo was of the opinion that to hand over Sihayo's relations would have affected his standing as king since Sihayo was his personal representative on the Natal border. He was also reluctant to hand over Mehlokazulu, who was a royal favourite. Mehlokazulu was also an iNduna in the iNgobamakhosi, the king's favourite iButho, and to hand him over would have insulted the regiment. Some of the king's iBandla thought he should consent to the British demand for members of Sihayo's family, believing it would placate the British. Sihayo was criticised by some iBandla members who blamed him for bringing the kingdom into conflict with the British.\nAnglo-Zulu War.\nNo response was received to the ultimatum and on 11 January 1879 British forces, under Lord Chelmsford invaded Zululand in three columns, starting the Anglo-Zulu War. Sihayo had been gathering cattle to pay the anticipated fine and a large herd were captured by the British centre column, led by Chelmsford which crossed into Zululand at Rorke's Drift. On 12 January Chelmsford sent a force to attack Sihayo's kraal to secure the left flank of his advance and in retribution for the border transgression. Sihayo had left his kraal to assemble with Cetshwayo's army at Ulundi, leaving around 200\u2013300 warriors under Mkumbikazulu. The British defeated Sihayo's men and burnt his kraal, also killing Mkumbikazulu. The survivors from this battle fled to Sotondose's Drift where, on 22 January, they helped kill British troops fleeing from their defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana. \nSihayo seems to have remained out of battle during the war but, together with Mehlokazulu, accompanied the army on its march to Isandlwana. Sihayo's scouts were the only mounted troops in the army. His brother Gamdana decided to submit to the British and met with Chelmsford at Isandlwana on 21 January, the day prior to British defeat. Sihayo's son Tshekwane was killed by a party of mounted men from the 80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers), operating from the western column in the days following the battles of Hlobane and Khambula in late March 1879. The war ended with the defeat of the Zulu by Chelmsford at the 4 July Battle of Ulundi, which Sihayo watched from a nearby hill.\nPost-war.\nIn August, immediately after the end of the war, Cetshwayo's senior chief Mnyamana kaNgqengelele confiscated all of Sihayo's cattle, as he blamed him for starting the war. As cattle was the basis of wealth in the kingdom Sihayo was left impoverished. As part of the peace terms the British imposed the division of Zululand into 13 chiefdoms, the abolition of the iButho system and the exile of Cetshwayo. The two chiefdoms on the Natal border were granted to Hlubi, a Basuto chief who had fought on the British side, in the west and John Robert Dunn, a British settler who had held territory in pre-war Zululand, in the east. Sihayo's lands fell in Hlubi's chiefdom and in the particular domain of a sub-chief Faku, also a Basuto. Faku ordered Sihayo and Mehlokazulu to leave his territory and Sihayo was left landless. \nSihayo continued to support the royalist uSuthu faction, which campaigned for the return of Cetshwayo. There was sporadic violence between the uSuthu and the new chiefs and the British recognised that the partition had not worked. Cetshwayo was permitted to return but was granted authority over only nine of the chiefdoms in the centre of Zululand. He was left surrounded by the territories of pro-British chiefs to the north and a Zulu Reserve Territory (formed from Hlubi and Dunn's chiefdoms) to the south. This only served to intensify the conflict into the Third Zulu Civil War in 1883. Following the second partition Sihayo had sought refuge in the eastern portion of the Zulu Reserve Territory with the remaining Qungebe. They were attacked there by Hlubi's Tlokwa.\nThe uSuthu invaded the chiefdom of the pro-British Zibhebhu kaMaphitha but were routed by an assault by the Mandlakazi, who then counter-attacked Ulundi. Sihayo had rallied to Cetshwayo at the capital and was there when it was taken by the Mandlakazi in July 1883. He was killed in a hut on 2 July, as were 50 other royalist chiefs and izinDuna. Cetshwayo died in exile and the former kingdom was formally annexed by the British in 1887.", "Mountain of Piss\n\nMountain of Piss is the 11th studio album by Australian punk rock band Cosmic Psychos, released on 9 July 2021 through Go the Hack Records.

The BEEP was meant as a replacement to old jeepneys in urban areas, hence the vehicles provided under the BEEP program are described as jeepneys. The vehicles under the BEEP program were tested as early as 2014 and were turned over to their operators in October 2016. The program was a private sector initiative by two groups namely the Kilusan sa Pagbabago ng Industriya ng Transportasyon (Kapit) and 1-Transport Equipment Aggregator and Management (1Team). The initial BEEP vehicles were provided through a loan by the Development Bank of the Philippines. It was intended that the BEEP vehicles not to operate as a single franchise.\nIn 2018, BDO Leasing and Finance (a Banco de Oro subsidiary) entered into a loan agreement with 1Team to finance at least five BEEP units. In December 2018, BEEP vehicles started servicing passengers in Cebu City.\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, BEEP made a full transition to a contactless payment for its Metro Manila fleet's fare collection system on October 1, 2020. This required all passengers to pay their fare through BeepRides, a contactless smart card. The similarity of the branding of BEEP's smart card and vehicles caused confusion with AF Payment's Beep card. This led to the Department of Transportation issuing a clarification that the BeepRides card and Beep (of AF Payment) are owned by two different companies.\nPayment system.\nThe fare of BEEP's riders are process through an automated fare collection system. Riders have to use a contactless smart card known as BeepRides to pay their fare. Since October 1, 2020, all riders of BEEP had to pay their pay through their contactless smart card. The BeepRides card is distinct from AF Payment's Beep card also used in Metro Manila; with the former used for BEEP jeepneys while the latter is used for the MRT\u2013LRT elevated rail systems and the buses operating in the EDSA Busway. The BeepRides card could also be used for select non-BEEP buses.\nThe automated fare collection system was tested as early as 2016, in six BEEP vehicles plying the Cubao-Lagro route and the Parang-Stop &amp; Shop Marikina route.\nFleet.\nThe vehicles used for the Beep Rides system are referred to as the Bagong Jeepney (BEEP). The vehicles are provided by IKK Ichigan, Inc. Some vehicles have their own air-conditioning system and are equipped with GPS tracking devices, dashboard cameras and CCTV cameras. BEEP vehicles, depending on the model, have the capacity to seat 16, 24 or 26 passengers at a time.", "Hangzhou\u2013Haining intercity railway\n\nThe Hangzhou\u2013Haining Intercity Rail (, abbreviation: HHCJ), also known as the Hanghai line, is a commuter rail line connected to, but operated independently of the Hangzhou Metro that connects the cities Hangzhou and Haining in Zhejiang, China.

Therefore, researchers who studied the monument, in determining its history, relied mainly on architectural features. According to A. Salamzadeh, one of the main elements pointing to the history of the mausoleum is the settlement of the entrance in the form of a small relief portal. This approach is typical of the 17th-century Azerbaijani mausoleums. The shape of the arch that completes the portal is also characteristic of that period. Although such arches have been known for their purpose since ancient times, they were used as a decorative element only after the 17th century.\nArchitecture.\nA. Salamzadeh writes that due to a number of features, the Gurjulu Mausoleum has a unique position among the octagonal mausoleums of Azerbaijan. The main feature of the mausoleum is the transition from its main architectural mass to the tent-shaped roof. The architect was able to create an original trumpet-shaped structure based on the shape of stalactite. In this way, he was able to make the transition from the octagonal plan to the hexagonal tent-shaped roof with a ring.\nThe architect's completely independent approach to the tectonic boundary of the transition cornice to the tent gave the mausoleum a unique look. According to the architect, the boundary of each axis of the tent is adapted to the tromp-shaped patterns of the ledge. This form of solution allowed to combine both parts of the mausoleum organically. At the same time, this method formed the plasticity and softness of the face of the monument. The architect managed to soften the rigid geometric shape of the octagonal mausoleums, complete with an octagonal tent.\nThe architect also designed the entrance in the form of a low-rise door, preserving the architectural traditions created by his predecessors.", "Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament final\n\nThe 2012 Summer Olympic football final was a football match that took place at Wembley Stadium in London, United Kingdom on 11 August 2012 to determine the winner of the men's football tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

An important tree used in traditional medical practices for the treatment of malaria and various diseases in Nigeria and Cameroon; oil extracted from stem barks and leaves of the species and \"Annickia affinis\", its more common close kin have been widely studied.\nThe species is sometimes credited by the generic name, \"Enantia chlorantha\".\nTaxonomy.\nNamed after Annickia Le Thomas, the genus Annickia belonging to the Annonaceae family was preceded by Enantia Oliv (1867). After further research unearthed Enantia as a legitimate genus of the Sabiaceae family, first published by Falconer in 1842. A revision in 1990 changed the title of the genus Enantia Oliv to become the genus Annickia. Both \"Annickia chlorantha\" and \"Annickia affinis\" are closely related medical trees and many traditional practice users and some researchers do not distinguish between the two with the latter crediting both with the name \"Enantia chlorantha\".\nDescription.\nLeaf-blades are papery to coriaceous, narrowly elliptical to obovate in outline, blades range between 7 - 28 cm long and 2 - 9.5 cm wide, acuminate at apex and narrowly cuneate at base. Slightly discolorous; adaxial surface is rarely pubescent and is usually brown to grey green but glossy dark green when fresh while the lower surface is bright brown to green but whitish to pale green when fresh with bifid or trifid hairs pointing in all directions.\nDistribution.\nOccurs in lowland forests and along road sides in Southern Nigeria and Cameroun.\nUses.\nStem bark and occasionally root decoction of Annickia chlorantha and its closely related cousin, Annickia affinis (Exell) is used to treat symptoms associated with malaria, tuberculosis, jaundice, yellow fever, typhoid and hepatitis A, B and C.", "Super envy-freeness\n\nA super-envy-free division is a kind of a fair division. It is a division of resources among \"n\" partners, in which each partner values his/her share at strictly \"more\" than his/her due share of 1/\"n\" of the total value, and simultaneously, values the share of every other partner at strictly less than 1/\"n\". Formally, in a super-envy-free division of a resource \"C\" among \"n\" partners, each partner \"i\", with value measure \"Vi\", receives a share \"Xi\" such that:formula_1.This is a strong fairness requirement: it is stronger than both envy-freeness and super-proportionality.\nExistence.\nSuper envy-freeness was introduced by Julius Barbanel in 1996. He proved that a super-envy-free cake-cutting exists if-and-only-if the value measures of the \"n\" partners are \"linearly independent\". \"Linearly independent\" means that there is no vector of \"n\" non-zero real numbers formula_2 for which formula_3,\nComputation.\nIn 1999, William Webb presented an algorithm that finds a super-envy-free allocation in this case. His algorithm is based on a \"witness\" to the fact that the measures are independent. A witness is an \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrix, in which element (\"i\",\"j\") is the value assigned by agent \"i\" to some piece \"j\" (where the pieces 1...,\"n\" can be any partition of the cake, for example, partition to equal-length intervals). The matrix should be invertible - this is a witness to the linear independence of the measures.\nUsing such a matrix, the algorithm partitions each of the \"n\" pieces in a near-exact division. It can be shown that, if the matrix is invertible and the approximation factor is sufficiently small (w.r.t. the values in the inverse of the matrix), then the resulting allocation is indeed super-envy-free.\nThe run-time of the algorithm depends on the properties of the matrix. However, if the value measures are drawn uniformly at random from the unit simplex, with high probability, the runtime is polynomial in \"n\".", "2004 Aquitaine regional election\n\nA regional election took place in Aquitaine on 21 March and 28 March 2004, along with all other regions.

The Natanz nuclear facility is located in the wilderness of the province of Isfahan, in central Iran. This site is scouted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog.\nBackground.\nIran's nuclear program was long suspected of aiming to create a nuclear weapon, with multiple countries, including the US and Israel, using methods to try and prevent this. \nIran initially denied they were creating a nuclear weapon, and insisted their nuclear technology was only being used for peaceful purposes such as power generation. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons. This fatwa is viewed with suspicion in the West, with some experts questioning its existence, impact or applicability. \nA cyber attack known as Operation Olympic Games was carried out by the US and Israel against Iran's nuclear facilities, specifically Natanz. This operation used the Stuxnet computer virus, which caused the destruction of hundreds of centrifuges and other damage. The virus was first discovered in 2010, but it is thought to have been in development since at least 2005.\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, repealed by the US in 2018, granted sanctions relief in exchange for destruction of technology and material that could aid nuclear weapons development. After the JCPOA was repealed by the US, Iran started openly ignoring its provisions, enriching uranium beyond the specified limits. By 2022, Iran was \"speaking openly on nuclear bomb prospects\".\nLocation.\nNatanz nuclear facility is part of Iran's nuclear program. It is located in the central province of Isfahan, near a major highway, and is generally recognized as Iran's central facility for uranium enrichment. This site was made underground, some 250\u00a0km (155 miles) south of the Iranian capital Tehran, to resist enemy airstrikes.\nIncident.\nOn 10 April 2021, Iran unveiled feeding gas to several all-Iranian centrifuges, including 164 IR6 machines, 30 IR5 centrifuges, 30 IR6s centrifuges, and mechanical tests on the advanced IR9 machine on the National Nuclear Technology Day occasion. On 11 April 2021, early on Sunday, the day after the Iran unveiling, a Blackout hit the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran which caused damage to the electrical distribution grid. The blackout seemed to be caused by a planned blast. The Natanz incident happened almost a week after Iran and Biden tried to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which President Trump had unilaterally withdrawn.\nThere were different reports of the attack, including a cyber-attack and an explosion. Iran, citing security issues, refused to reveal additional information. Israel publicly rejected to approve or deny any responsibility for the incident. The US and Israel intelligence officials claimed that Israel was behind a cyber-attack at the time of this incident.\nAftermath.\nAli Akbar Salehi, the AEOI head claimed that the incident was an act of \"sabotage\" and \"nuclear terrorism\".\nSeveral Israeli media claimed that the operation was carried out by the Israeli Mossad spy service. Israel had expressed dissatisfaction over Biden's revival of the nuclear deal, which the United States unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA on May 8, 2018. Iran does not recognize the existence of Israel and often refers to it as the \"Zionist state.\"\nOn the morning of the accident, Lloyd Austin, the American defense secretary, met with Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz and viewed Israeli air and missile defense systems and its F-35 combat aircraft. It was not clear whether they had discussed the Natanz attack.\nDamage.\nKamalvandi, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman, said that the accident caused no casualties nor pollution.\nSeveral Israeli media say that the blackout has allotted a hard blow to Iran's uranium enrichment.\nAlireza Zakani said that the damage was great and that several thousand centrifuges were damaged, on the Ofoq TV channel.\nAccording to The New York Times, two intelligence officials claimed: it had been made by the accident that destroyed the internal power system responsible for feeding underground uranium enrichment centrifuges. Israel has taken action ranging against Iran, from cyberattacks to the killings of several Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years.\nReconstruction.\nOn November 17, 2021, the IAEA released their quarterly safeguards report regarding verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran, in light of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). The report concludes that the number of enriching IR-1 cascades and IR-2m cascades at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) appear to have almost fully recovered from a sabotage incident in April. Iran installed 31 cascades of IR-1 centrifuges, six cascades of IR-2m centrifuges, and two cascades of IR-4 centrifuges at the FEP. Of those, as of November 13, 28 IR-1 cascades, six IR-2m cascades, and two IR-4 cascades \u201cwere being fed\u201d with uranium.\nReactions.\nIran has blamed Israel for the Natanz accident and the Mohsen Fakhrizadeh assassination in November 2020.\nHassan Rouhani, President of Iran has said that in response to the attack, Iran will increase enriching uranium by up to 60% and will replace the old centrifuges with more advanced ones.\nAli Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, called the incident a terrorist act and said that the Natanz accident showed the opponents of the country's industrial and political progress have failed in preventing significant development of the nuclear industry. He announced that Iran will build a new hall \"in the heart of the mountain\" near Natanz.\nMohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, in a letter to Antonio Guterres, described the Natanz sabotage as \"a grave war crime\" due to the high risk of potential release of radioactive material, and said that any power that is aware of the crime, must be held accountable as an accomplice to this war crime. He also condemned two Israeli attacks on Natanz in one year.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that \"the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission\". Already, he warned about the return of the U.S to JCPOA and said: that the new deal will not be binding on Israel.\nAfter this sabotage at Natanz, that has been attributed to Israel, the European Union described these actions as efforts to endanger talks to return the US to JCPOA and send out a warning.\nAviv Kochavi, the Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces said: \"operations in the Middle East are not hidden from the eyes of the enemy\".\nAccording to Reuters, diplomats said that due to security concerns following the Israeli attack on the Natanz site in April, Iran has been restricting access by U.N. nuclear inspectors to its main uranium enrichment site in Natanz.", "Klemen Pucko\n\nKlemen Pucko (born 27 January 1996) is a Slovenian football defender who plays for N\u0160 Mura.", "The Most High\n\nThe Most High can refer to:", "Alen Kozar\n\nAlen Kozar (born 7 April 1995) is a Slovenian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Singapore Premier League club Balestier Khalsa.", "Dujone (TV series)\n\nDujone is a Bengali-language streaming television series streaming on hoichoi from July 9, 2021.

A second species of southern African \"Schoenus\" that has brown culm bases is \"Schoenus bracteosus\"; however, that species has firm primary inflorescence bracts that enclose its spikes \u2014 a character absent from \"S. brunnescens\". \nSimilar to \"Schoenus compactus\" and \"Schoenus crassus\", \"S. brunnescens\" has straight and stiff basal culm leaves (i.e. leaves at the base of its flowering stems). However, the culm bases of \"S. compactus\" and \"S. crassus\" are generally more reddish-brown compared to the ones of \"S. brunnescens\". In addition, the spikelets of \"S. compactus\" and \"S. crassus\" are generally longer and the nutlets larger compared to those of \"S. brunnescens\". \nThe inflorescence of \"S. brunnescens\" is generally more elongate and thinner compared to the more congested (i.e. compact) panicle of \"S. compactus\".\nTaxonomy.\n\"Schoenus brunnescens\" is a species in family Cyperaceae, tribe Schoeneae, which also includes the genera \"Costularia\", \"Lepidosperma\", \"Oreobolus\", \"Tetraria\" and \"Gahnia\". Based on preliminary phylogenetic evidence, \"Schoenus brunnescens\" is closely related to other southern African \"Schoenus\" species in the \"S. cuspidatus\" and allies group, specifically, \"S. compactus\" and \"S. crassus\".\nThe southern African \"Schoenus\" were once classified as \"Tetraria\"; however, we now know that the two groups are evolutionary distinct based on molecular and morphological differences. To ensure that this group of sedges is monophyletic (i.e. the genus only has closely related species), several species of \"Epischoenus\" and the southern African \"Tetraria\" were transferred into \"Schoenus\". Plants classified as \"Schoenus\" can be distinguished from \"Tetraria\" in the field by the absence of reticulate sheaths at the bases of the flowering stems and the lack of stem leaves in \"Schoenus\".\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe known distribution of \"S. brunnescens\" is from the Rooi Els and Worcester areas in the west to the Langeberg Mountains to the east of the Western Cape Province.\nThe reported elevation range of \"S. brunnescens\" is from 70-610 m, and this species usually grows on coarse-textured soils in the fynbos vegetation type.", "John Cliffe\n\nJohn Cliffe (1661\u20131728) was an Irish barrister, landowner and politician. He sat in the Irish House of Commons for many years, where he was often called on to speak for the Government, and held the office of Serjeant-at-law (Ireland).\nHe was probably born at Dungulf Castle, near Fethard-on-Sea, County Wexford. He was the eldest son among the eleven children of John Cliffe and Eleanor Loftus, fifth daughter of Nicholas Loftus of Fethard and Margaret Chetham. His father was a trusted Cromwellian official who came to Ireland in 1649 to serve as secretary to Henry Ireton, son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell and Lord Deputy of Ireland. Cliffe was sometimes referred to as the Irish \"Secretary of War\", though this was not his official title. At the Restoration of Charles II his Cromwellian past was not held against him: he was confirmed in the numerous grants of land he had received in Wexford and in County Meath, including Dungulf and Mulrankin. He became a respected local politician, serving as MP for Taghmon 1661-6 and High Sheriff of Wexford 1680-81. He died in 1691.\nJohn, the son, was called to the Bar and became Third Serjeant in 1711, and Second Serjeant in 1712. Government Law Officers, including the Serjeants, then were strictly political appointments, and Cliffe as a Tory, in common with virtually all of the Irish judges and Law Officers, was summarily dismissed on the accession of George I in 1714.\nIn 1693 and 1698 he sat on a Commission to organise a Government loan. He sat in the Parliament of Ireland as member for Bannow in every Parliament from 1695 until his retirement from politics in 1727. So long as the Tory Party was in power, he was a leading Government speaker in the Commons. He died at New Ross in 1728.\nHe married Barbara Carr, eldest daughter of William Carr of Cork city in 1694, and they had sixteen children, including John, the eldest son and heir, Barbara, Mary and Ellinor (died 1745). Ellinor married Charles Tottenham MP and had at least six children including Sir John Tottenham, 1st Baronet, who was the father of the first Marquess of Ely. Mary married John Leigh of Rosegarland, County Wexford: their descendants were still living at Rosegarland in the 21st century. Barbara married Arthur Gifford of County Cork and had issue.\nIn the early nineteenth century, the Cliffe family bought Bellevue, Ballyhogue, County Wexford, which became the main family residence.

He was also part of the early British alternative comedy movement in the 1980s.\nEarly life.\nBarclay was born in South Shields but brought up in South East London, the son of a deputy headmaster. He went to comprehensive school in 1958, where he started acting in school plays and was encouraged by his drama teacher to join the National Youth Theatre. He went on to study at the New College of Speech and Drama.\nCareer.\nTheatre.\nBarclay started his career working in Theatre-in-Education, starting in 1969 at the Newcastle Playhouse Regional Extension Unit. He went on to work with left-wing alternative theatre groups, notably and Mayday Theatre, where he met Tony Allen. Barclay's disillusionment with traditional anti-establishment arts - \"there must be a more honest, less patronizing way of getting ideas across to people\" \u2013 led him to move to political comedy. After his involvement with alternative comedy, he returned to theatre acting in the late 1980s, spending three years with the National Theatre. In 2014, he starred as Scrooge in the Derby Theatre's production of \"A Christmas Carol\".\nComedy.\nEncouraged by Tony Allen, Barclay began performing comedy in the early days of the London Comedy Store. By 1981, Barclay was compering shows at the Comedy Store, an article from \"The Sun\" noting his skill in this role: \"Jim is a pro. They don't muck about with him, even at The Comedy Store.\" Along with Alexei Sayle, Andy de la Tour and others, he was one of a group of comedians who formed the politically-charged comedy group Alternative Cabaret, which staged shows at the Elgin pub in Ladbroke Grove in 1979\u201380, and in gigs around London and beyond. Tony Allen has described how he, Barclay and Andy de la Tour supported each other in developing their respective stand-up acts: \"All three of us were struggling to understand what we were doing and we gave each other valuable feedback and helped nurse each other's wounds.\" Barclay appeared in Alternative Cabaret's 1981 show at the Edinburgh Fringe, and a recording of his act appears on the Alternative Cabaret LP. In 1984, he devised an anti-nuclear one-man show called \"Four Minutes to Midnight\", which he performed at the Edinburgh Fringe and elsewhere, being one of the first of the new generation of alternative comedians to take a full-length solo production to the Edinburgh Fringe, pioneering a style of theme-based show taken up by comedians in the decades that followed. Barclay's style on stage was both highly political and ridiculous, exploring the absurdity of using comedy to promote radical change while at the same time being part of the general \"alternative\" challenge to 1970s mainstream comedy culture. He would tell audiences, \"Well, as you've gathered from what you've seen so far of my act, I'm the Marxist-Leninist comedian. And I tell jokes which precipitate the downfall of capitalist society\". His act has been described as an example of how alternative comedy played with the politics of pleasure and \"the boundaries between what audiences want and what they feel they should want\". He evolved an \"agitprop\" style he described as 'wacky and zany', adopting a costume which included yellow tights, T-shirts with slogans like 'Loot British', and a hat which incorporated both a joke nail-through-the-head and deeley boppers. A review of a show at Brickies Club in Poole in January 1984 describes Barclay's act: 'All \"come on\", chat and cheerfully manic aggression, with his silly hat, yellow lyrics tights and massive physical presence, he seemed more like Alternative comedy's answer to Tommy Cooper.' In June 1984, Barclay appeared in three different guises in an event staged by the Labour Party at the Wembley Conference Centre called \"A Night for a Nuclear Free Europe\". He appeared performing his own stand-up act, in character as a comic alien among the \"Pre-Curtain Up and Interval Entertainers\", and running an \"Interval Competition\" in the second internval. Following the event, Neil Kinnock, then the leader of the Labour Party, wrote a letter of thanks to Barclay, saying, \"I wish to thank you for your splendid contribution to Labour's Night for a Nuclear Free Europe at Wembley...I think we have really hit on a winning formula for political entertainment which can appeal to a far larger audience than the usual political meeting.\"\nTelevision.\nIn 1986, Barclay starred in the popular BBC children's football-based drama \"Jossy's Giants\", playing the eponymous Jossy Blair, a former child football star injured shortly after his debut for Newcastle United, now charged with coaching a local school team to greatness. Barclay also appeared on television a number of times as a comedian, notably performing his stand-up act on \"Book 'Em and Risk It\" (Channel 4, 1983), \"Stomping on the Cat\" (Channel 4, 1984), and \"Interference\" (Channel 4, 1984). As an actor, he appeared in three episodes of the seminal alternative comedy series \"The Young Ones\": (Boring, Flood and Sick). He has appeared in several episodes of both \"Grange Hill\" and \"The Bill\".\nPersonal life.\nBarclay is the father of comedian and journalist Ellie Gibson, who is half of the double act Scummy Mummies, who perform live shows and produce \"The Scummy Mummies Podcast\".\nBarclay first encountered duvets in Berlin in 1968.\nCollections.\nThe University of Kent holds material relating to Barclay's career as part of the British Stand-Up Comedy Archive.

He was known for his television specials for Christmas and Mother's Day. Before becoming a musician, he was a basketball player and referee, founding the local club SCVU.\nHe wrote one of the SuriPop 2008 finalist songs, \"A Song of Life\", which was performed by his three daughters. His youngest daughter Zoureena Rijger was Miss Suriname 2009.\nCareer.\nRijger attended the Paulus School in Suriname. He played for the local basketball teams CLD and De Arend. As a leader of the Social Cultural Association Uitvlugt (SCVU in Dutch), Rijger decided to start a basketball team for the area. After studying basketball training in Mexico, he returned and founded the team SCVU with Paul \"Pa Lefi\" Leeflang in 1964, becoming its vice-president. He also worked as a referee. Although Rijger later shifted his focus to music, he maintained ties with SCVU. Under Rijger's leadership, the SCVU team was promoted to the top league of the Suriname Basketball Federation. In 1969, Rijger took a job with the tax authorities as a bailiff, which he would maintain for 35 years.\nRijger began his career in music in the 1970s: he started a band called 'The Drifter', which played pop, blues and oldies. In the 1980s, his sister Magda Jessurun-Rijger asked him to enter a country music festival with her. They then decided to start a band called \"Country Roads\", which would host line dance nights. When Magda emigrated to the Netherlands in the 1990s, Rijger continued solo, sometimes collaborating with other country artists like Ren\u00e9 Nelson. Rijger performed at casinos, hotels (like the Hotel Torarica), and house parties throughout Suriname; he would also organise and perform in television specials for Christmas and Mother's Day. Rijger wrote many of his own songs, including Christmas songs. He also started the Country and Western Music Suriname foundation.\nFamily.\nRijger married Nisa Chandoe in 1984. Rijger and Nisa had five children: two sons and three daughters. One son died in infancy. The remaining four children (son Garry and daughters Cheryll, Xaviera and Zoureena) joined Rijger in his performances when they were older: Garry would be the DJ, and the sisters would sing as a trio. As Rijger also played football in recreational clubs, he did occasional coaching of the youth football teams Puwa Nani and Bintang Baru '82, and would have his children attend the practices.\nGarry died in 2004: while walking along a road, he was hit by a taxi whose driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. Rijger was greatly impacted by Garry's death: he took early retirement from his job as a bailiff, and stopped performing for three years. He returned slowly to performing, with Nisa as the DJ. For four months in 2007, the family ran their own club, the \"Lex Rijger Countryclub\" on Henck Arron Street in Paramaribo; after the club closed, they continued holding line dancing events at different venues. Rijger's original song \"A Song of Life\", performed by his daughters, was one of the ten final selections for SuriPop in 2008. His youngest daughter Zoureena Rijger was Miss Suriname 2009.\nHis eldest daughter Cheryll married the actor Ruben Welles in 2019. His daughters continued to perform one or two country songs in their concerts even while they shifted to more house music and pop.\nIllness and death.\nRijger's last performance was in 2013. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2014, but had been experiencing forgetfulness and other symptoms for several years before.\nHe died on 23 June 2021 at the age of 76. His funeral was held on 2 July at the Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral, Paramaribo.

Marist Old Boys won their 3rd first grade title with their previous coming in 1924 and 1931.\nRichmond Rovers won the Roope Rooster for the 5th time when they beat City Rovers 20\u20138 in the final. City had not won a trophy since 1925 but had been boosted mid season by the addition of Bob Banham who the Auckland Rugby League had brought over from Australia as a player coach. Richmond also won the Stormont Shield for the 4th time when they defeated Marist Old Boys 9\u20138. Eastern Suburbs (NSWRL runner up) toured at the end of the season and Richmond were the only team to beat them when they won 11\u20139. Eastern Suburbs beat Marist (36-15), Manukau (16-7) and a South Auckland (Waikato) team (17-5).\nManukau, who were coached by former Kiwi Bert Laing won the Phelan Shield for the first time after they beat Papakura18-8 in the final. The Phelan Shield at this time was played for by the teams which had been knocked out of the Roope Rooster. Richmond Rovers won the reserve grade competition (Norton Cup) after they were tied with Mount Albert United after the final round and a final was necessary to decide the champion. Richmond won the match 16\u201310. They also won the Stallard Cup when they won the reserve grade knockout competition beating Marist 18\u20137 in the final. The Senior B competition (Sharman Cup) was comfortably won by Otahuhu Rovers who finished 5 competition points ahead of Green Lane. Ellerslie United won the Walmesley Shield which was the senior B knockout competition although this season it was played over 2 full rounds.\nClaude Dempsey, the Newton fullback, and former NZ international player was awarded the J.F.W. Dickson's medal for being the most sportsmanlike player in the senior grade. Junior awards went to J. Means and J. McWilliams.\nThe representative season saw Auckland play three matches. They defeated a Rest of the North Island side easily by 67 points to 14. They then beat the returning New Zealand team which had toured Australia by 21 points to 13. Then in August they defeated Canterbury 28\u201322 at Carlaw Park. The North Island team which beat the South Island was dominated by Auckland players with only Joe Cootes (Wellington) being from outside Auckland. They thrashed the South Island 55 points to 2. Unsurprisingly 18 of the New Zealand team selected to tour Australia were Auckland players. The Auckland M\u0101ori team played just one match which was against an Auckland P\u0101keh\u0101 side and ran out 26 to 21 winners.\n \n \nAuckland Rugby League meeting and news.\nPreliminary meeting.\nAt a meeting on February 17 the Auckland Rugby League decided to start the senior competition at the early date on April 2 due to the tour of New Zealand to Australia during the season. The date for the annual meeting was set at March 23. At the conclusion of the meeting they inspected the new lighting which has been installed at Carlaw Park in order to accommodate night football.\nAnnual general meeting.\nThe report which was to be presented at the annual general meeting showed that the balance sheet for the Auckland Rugby League was \u00a33605s at the end of the 1937 season which was an increase of \u00a321 on the previous season. There was an excess of assets over liabilities of \u00a37598 12s 9d. At the annual meeting on March 23 Mr. John A. Lee presided as president. He said \"last year the code made great progress... and we are opening the greatest season we have ever had. Co-operation and good spirit shown by players and officials was to a large degree responsible for this success... after years of difficulty last year we reached the strength to warrant a team being sent and tested on the playing fields of Australia... great responsibility rests with the officials to see that a fine team be sent this season\". He went on to declare \"that league was a democratic code. No class distinction could enter if the game was to progress. He paid tribute to the great work of the ladies\u2019 committees, whose social activities during the year did much to aid the code\". Mr. G. Grey Campbell, chairman of the control board, said \"it was pleasing to note that there had been no incidents at Carlaw Park last year, and not a single senior player had come before the board for irregular conduct on the field. During the summer improvements had been made at Carlaw Park, and the system of flood lighting, which was so successful for sports events, would make night football possible\". Tribute was paid to Ivan Culpan who had been secretary for the league for 20 years. During the meeting Archie Ferguson appealed for more senior matches to be played on outside grounds, particularly at the Devonport Domain with Mr. Campbell saying that the matter would be considered. Along with John A. Lee, four other members of parliament were also present, including Messrs, William Theophilus Anderton, Frederick William Schramm, Arthur George Osborne, and Arthur Shapton Richards who all \"spoke of the success of the code in Auckland\".

The Eastern Suburbs team which was touring Auckland at the time were honorary guests.\nAuckland Rugby League life memberships.\nJim Clark.\nOtahuhu nominated Jim Clark, who had recently been elected as returning president of their club as a life member of Auckland Rugby League. The league agreed and he was elected a life member of the ARL. It was stated that he \"had been actively identified with the game for 25 years and had given much service as an official in the Otahuhu district for some years past. It was mentioned that Mr. Clark was an international, having twice played with New Zealand teams in Australia\".\nFrank Thompson.\nAt the board of control meeting on June 22 Frank Thompson was made a life member. He joined the code in 1913 through the Remuera club. Thompson was an ex-member of the Referees\u2019 Association for 17 years and spent 5 years on the grading, examination and appointment board. He also spent four years as a selector and six years with the junior management. Thompson was also a member of the New Zealand Referees\u2019 Association for 10 years as a representative of the Auckland and the Northland leagues. He was also heavily involved in the acquisition and formation of Carlaw Park.\nRugby league ground allocation.\nOn April 14 the Auckland Park and Reserves Committee met to allocate fields to the various winter codes. The chairman of the committee was Ted Phelan who was also on the Auckland Rugby League board. The fields allocated to rugby league were Cricket Ground (2), Outer Domain (1), Victoria Park (1), Walker Park (2), Western Springs (2), Grey Lynn Park (1), with \u2018Stadium\u2019 reserved. It was commented that there was a \"spirit of harmony\" between the codes.\nGeorge Gillett donated trophy.\nIn June, former All Black and NZ rugby league international George Gillett, donated a \"handsome silver cup to the Auckland Rugby League for any competition which the league may desire. The trophy was presented through Mr. H. Walmsley\". It was decided during the season to award the trophy to the winner of the 4th grade competition which was ultimately City Rovers.\nPapakura promoted to the Fox Memorial competition.\nAt the annual meeting on March 23 it was announced that Papakura were being promoted from the Senior B grade which they had won comfortably for 2 consecutive seasons to the Fox Memorial competition. Their backs would include Richard and A. Burgess, E Cossey, G Osborne, Phillips, J McInnes and Martin though it was said that their \"strength will probably be in the forwards\". While J Fogarty, D Evans, Buckeridge, C Ross, and Slater made a \"good impression\" in their preliminary match against Marist. It was rumoured that Cliff Satherley may also play for them. He didn't though former New Zealand representative Norm Campbell did play a handful of games to begin the season.\nGeorge N\u0113pia joins Manukau.\nOn March 10 it was reported that George Nepia would join the Manukau club. He would arrive in Onehunga later in March and would be accompanied by Tuhoro, who was \"last year's outstanding forward for East Coast and Hawke's Bay\". The Manukau team would be extremely strong with the selectors saying that their senior side would be selected from George Nepia, Jack Hemi, Rangi Chase, Angus Gault, Jack Brodrick, Walter Brimble, Tommy Chase, Pita Ririnui, Jack Broughton, R. Wilson, McKinlay, Peter Mahima, Jack Whye, Tuhoro (2), Kakau, Tane, and Phillips. It was then reported in late March that there were doubts that he would in fact play for Manukau however he ultimately did for a few weeks.\nSenior team preseason and prospects.\nOn March 26 several teams held organised practices with the Manukau side playing a South Auckland XIII at Waikaraka Park. Newton, Marist, City, and Ponsonby all practised at Carlaw Park while Richmond were at Grey Lynn Park. It was reported that Ponsonby were to be coached by Bill Davidson who was a past City Rovers player who also represented Auckland 14 times from 1920 to 1923 and New Zealand 16 times from 1919 to 1921.\nIt was reported that Richmond Rovers had erected a dressing and club rooms at Grey Lynn Park and that the senior team would be a strong one with Mervyn Devine joining the forwards. He was a Wellington Rugby representative. However Ted Mincham was transferring from Richmond to Mount Albert. They would still have the services of \"Powell, Bickerton, and Wally Tittleton for their inside backs who know when others play well and Wally Tittleton is particularly clever at taking the gap and improving a movement for the men outside him. The form showed [after the preliminary games] by Mills and Abbie Graham, two of the juniors can earn them permanent places in the senior team, [while] Furnell was the most improved full back in Auckland last season\".\nThe Manukau side was considered to be shaping as \"a very formidable team\" with the \"forwards particularly strong, and perhaps the heaviest ever seen in club football. The average weight will be nearly 14 stone. This should be a great season for Jack Brodrick, whose brilliant form in the M\u0101ori match against Australia last year, stamps him as the finest forward seen in the code for many years\". They were also adding Pita Ririnui and \"he should soon rise to All Black honours\" according to the Auckland Star reporter. After their first preliminary game (which he did not play in) it was reported that Jack Hemi \"expressed a desire to play for Ponsonby, but the transfer might cause some difficulty\". After the match the Auckland Star said that Ririnui \"made a good impression on his first appearance and Brodrick, the best forward in Auckland last year, appears to be already in good form\". Mahika Panapa, the North Auckland Rugby Maori representative halfback signed on to play for Manukau prior to their first Fox Memorial game. In mid May, J. Craig, a representative rugby player from Nelson arrived in Auckland to join the Manukau club. He had represented the combined Nelson-Golden Bay-Motueka-Marlborough side who played the Springboks in 1937.\nMarist were reportedly gaining the services of Robert Grotte who was a former member and who had played as halfback for the St. George club in Sydney. After the first preliminary game they were said to be one of the strongest teams in the competition. \"In Haslam they have one of the best pivotal players in Auckland and in Halsey and Midgley very speedy wings... Grotte, the former Sydney player looks like being certain of a place. In Anderson, Butler and Breed they have a fine trio of forwards.\nPonsonby would have a similar team to the previous season with a strong backline and the forwards strengthened by J. Fraser from Taranaki who was said to be a \"splendid place-kick\". They had virtually the same backline as in the previous season and had gained the services of Clark who was a \"young player from Ellerslie [who had] the making of a good fullback.\nMount Albert were a suggested location for Bob Banham as they needed a \"link between the rugged Mount Albert forwards and the inside backs, where the weakness lay last season\". Ted Mincham joined Mount Albert from Richmond and \"with McNeil and McCallum outside him the Mount Albert three-quarter line should be a bit of a problem for their opponents... [while] their forwards appear to be just as strong as last season\". They were to be coached by former New Zealand player Stan Prentice. Following the first preliminary round of games at Carlaw Park on April 2 it was said that they \"have a good solid pack of forwards and have an exceptional back in R. Burgess who has great dash and pace [and that they] will further strengthen their team for the competition matches. It is probable that they will gain Lilburn, a good five eighths from Hunua. McRobbie, the Pokeno forward, while there is a possibility that Cliff Satherley, the former Richmond and Mount Albert forward will lead the pack. In mid May it was reported that Mount Albert had signed R.F. Ball who was a member of the Eastern Suburbs club in Sydney.\nNewton had had a relatively poor 1937 season though they had improved as the season went on. They had retained the services of Wilfred Brimble and Ted Brimble, and Crooks. While \"Kendall, a full back from North Auckland showed promise\", they also had a \"fairly good pack of forwards who stuck to their work well in the preliminary match\".\nCity were said after the first preliminary game to \"not appear to be exceptionally strong, and they will miss both Hawea Mataira and Donald, who were their best forwards last year. However, Hutchinson's form at the base of the scrum is excellent, Cyril Wiberg can be relied upon to gather points consistently with accurate goal kicking and the forwards may shake down into a solid combination\".\nNorth Shore were said to have a young team. With \"much interest taken in the appearance of Verdun Scott, whose cricket deeds are so well known. Scott played full back last season and is also a promising centre three-quarter\". Jack Smith who made a good impression at five eighths, is again available. Zane and Rhodes, of last years team, will also be playing. The forwards will include Simpson, Souter, Hunt and players from lower grades.\nSprigs.\nIt was decided to appoint a special committee to inspect players boots on Saturday's after St John Ambulance staff complained about injuries received by two players as the result of dangerous sprigs following the April 2 matches. The committee to inspect the boots each Saturday would be made up of Messrs. Mincham, Probert, and McAneny.\nInjury substitutions.\nAt the June 8 meeting of the control board the Referees\u2019 Association said that they would \"appreciate a ruling in regard to replacements\". There was a suspicion that \"a certain club had a player who came late, but another player conveniently \"became injured\" to allow the late player to enter play\". While at a different game a player left the field stating he had influenza, while other cases where players had gone \"off without advising the referee\". Mr Campbell agreed that if a player was not seriously injured then they or the team captain should report to the referee before a replacement can be made. And that \"a referee would be entitled to hold a game up to get a report from an ambulance man or doctor if there was ground for believing that injury was being shammed\". It was then decided that a committee consisting of the chairman and Messrs. D. Wilkie and W. Mincham would submit a recommendation.\nJunior football changes.\nAt a meeting of the junior management board on February 8 several suggestions were discussed in regards to changes that could be made for the 1938 season. The main changes suggested were a proposal to reduce the age limit for the 6th grade to 18 years, introducing an age limit of 19.5 years for the 5th grade, and starting an open grade for the \"first juniors, with a weight limit of 11st 7lb [73\u00a0kg], to obviate the need for two sections in the third grade\". At their annual meeting on March 8 the proposals were debated and it was eventually decided to adopt them. Additional ones included that the age limit for the 6th grade be 18 and for the 7th grade be 16. The season would start for juniors on April 30.\nRichmond club rooms opened at Grey Lynn Park.\nIn early May the Richmond club applied to celebrate the opening of their clubrooms at Grey Lynn Park on June 4 by holding a match with South Auckland on its bye date. On June 4 they were officially opened by Mr. J.A. Lee prior to a game against a combined team from Huntly. Lee said \"this is going to be a permanent home, and it is an object worthy of the highest praise\". While Joe Sayegh said that the Richmond club had \"done yeoman service in the interests of the players. He was pleased to say that the City Council was only too pleased to encourage similar buildings on other public properties\". Mr. Swift expressed the club's thanks to Mr. Ralph Jenkinson who supervised the building construction.\nLawson Park developed.\nIt was announced in mid March that Lawson Park would be developed. It would involve \"earthworks of which will take from four to five months to complete. After this stage both areas have to be grassed and other finishing touches added\". It had been started four years earlier \"as a means of creating work in the district for the local unemployed, but was halted when sustenance was introduced. Some months ago work was recommenced, giving work for 20 men. When it is finished, it will provide two basketball [better known as netball at this time] and two tennis courts on a higher level, and on the lower part a rugby or rugby league football ground\". It was said that \"to provide for the football ground, a good deal of excavation will be necessary, so that ultimately a fine, natural grandstand will be secured\". Twenty nine years later, in 1967 the New Lynn Rugby League club was established and Lawson Park became its home ground with their club rooms being built there.\nAuckland representative team.\nIn March the Auckland Rugby League board of control offered the Auckland representative coaching position to Bob Banham, the New South Wales representative five-eighths. A cable was received back from him accepting the position and he was expected to arrive in time for the matches on April 8. The board intended to place Banham in a local team \"for playing purposes\". It was reported that he had been unlucky to miss out on selection in the 1937 Australian team which toured England and he had also turned down an offer to coach Queensland. In early march it was decided to place Banham in the North Shore Albions side for six weeks and then review the placement. After six matches for North shore it was decided to leave him there for 3 more weeks before moving to and coaching the City team. Bert Avery, Hec Brisbane, and A Renwick were appointed selectors for Auckland for the season while Brisbane was nominated by Auckland to be one of the three selectors for the North Island side.\nObituary.\nGeorge Seagar (snr).\nIn August George Seagar died aged 73. He had two sons who both represented New Zealand, George Seagar and Allan Seagar. George senior was a strong supported of rugby league and was an original vice-president of the Auckland Rugby League. He was later made a life member in recognition of his services to the game. He was survived by a wife, seven sons and three daughters, with 25 grandchildren and one great grandchild.\nEastern Suburbs Tour.\nIn September/October the NSWRFL runner up Eastern Suburbs side toured Auckland. They played four matches against Marist Old Boys, Manukau, Richmond Rovers, and South Auckland. Their only loss was in the match against Richmond who had accumulated a remarkable record against touring Australian club teams.\nMarist v Eastern Suburbs.\nJoseph (Joe) Charles Woods for Marist broke his leg in the second half. He was aged 28 and was taken to Auckland Hospital. Marist was captained by Reginald Haslam. Among the 6 try scorers for Eastern Suburbs, 5 were Australian internationals.\nManukau v Eastern Suburbs.\nJack Hemi was unavailable for Manukau due to illness while they lost Jack Brodrick to a shoulder injury during the first half who was replaced by Ratu.\nSenior first grade competitions.\nPreliminary round.\nMervyn William Devine, the former Wellington rugby representative made his debut for the Richmond team.\nFox Memorial results.\nMarist won the competition when they defeated Newton in the final round. Had they lost there would have been a three-way tie for first with themselves, Mount Albert, and Newton all on 22 points from 11 wins each but their 10\u20137 win saw them outright winners with 12 wins and 4 losses. A key to their win was their defence which saw them only concede 121 points from 16 games, an average of less than 8 points per game. From round 7 until round 18 their points conceded was 8, 7, 2, 4, 3, 8, 0, 0, 4, 11, and 7.\nRound 1.\nPapakura played in their first ever Fox Memorial game in round 1. They lost a close match 17\u201314 against Richmond. In the match between Newton and Manukau the referee (J. Cottingham) was knocked out after a ball which had been kicked struck him in the face from point blank range. Percy Rogers who was waiting to referee the following match took over and refereed the last 10 minutes. Former New Zealand player, Norm Campbell debuted for Papakura, though he would only play a handful of matches before retiring from the sport.\n Rangi Chase was forced to leave the field with a shoulder injury.\nRound 3.\nThree players were sent off in the Manukau-Marist match as a result of an \"on field incident\". Jack Whye of Manukau was suspended for a week, Bill Breed of Marist was \"severely reprimanded\", while Bill Glover also of Marist was unable to attend the disciplinary hearing and was ordered to stand down until able to attend. In the match between City and Ponsonby, D Black of Ponsonby broke his knee cap and was ruled out for the season. They also lost Pat Young, and Frank Halloran to injuries during the match. They had previously lost former Kiwi Arthur Kay to a leg injury in an earlier match.\nRound 4.\nRichmond defeated North Shore after a late try awarded after an obstruction. However the referee allowed the ball carrier to run behind the posts with the conversion taken from in front. The rules stated that the kick should have been taken from inline with where the obstruction occurred. The league ordered the match to be replayed if required later in the season. As it turned out the match did not need to be replayed as it would have no bearing on the championship. Bob Banham had to retire during the match after receiving a cut above the eye after colliding with an opponent which required three stitches. Arthur McInnarney scored his first senior points for Mt Albert after transferring from the Ellerslie third grade team where he had been coached by Charles Gregory. He would be selected for New Zealand in 1939.\nRound 6.\nA highlight of the round was the debut appearance of George Nepia for Manukau in their win over Richmond. It was said that he had a \"sound game\" but did not look match fit. Pita Ririnui was sent off for Manukau and Alf Broadhead for Richmond near the end of the game for fighting. They were both severely cautioned by the control board with Broadhead warned that a similar offence would be dealt with more severely. Also during the match Jack Brodrick went off to have a dislocated finger attended to. When he came back on he found that he had been replaced and so referee Maurice Wetherill made him leave the field once more. A notable feature in the North Shore \u2013 Papakura game was that a total of 10 penalty goals were kicked. The goal kicking in the senior grade was arguably the strongest it has ever been with John Anderson, Jack Hemi, Jack Smith, and J McInnes kicking a large number of goals most weeks.\nRound 7.\nNew Zealand representatives, Jack and Dick Smith were both absent for North Shore after their father passed away during the week. Bob Banham had been moved by the Auckland Rugby League from the North Shore club to City Rovers where he played for the remainder of the season.\nRound 8.\nPapakura recorded their first ever win in the Fox Memorial competition with an 18\u201315 win over Manukau on Carlaw Park 2. Manukau were missing several of their best players who were on the New Zealand tour of Australia but still fielded a strong side. During the match Richard Burgess of Papakura fractured his left arm. Reginald Haslam was ordered off for Marist in their 13\u20137 win over Ponsonby. Ernie Pinches scored a try for Mt Albert in his first season for them. He had been born in England in 1914 before moving to New Zealand. He became well known for wrestling, holding the New Zealand light heavyweight title for 6 years in the 1950s. In the same decade he was elected to the Mt Roskill Borough Council. He was deputy mayor there from 1974 to 1987 and acting mayor from 1987 to 1988.\nRound 9.\nIn the match between Papakura and Mount Albert, the Papakura player Dobbyn had his nose broken. He was able to return to play a week later however. \nRound 10.\nThe Papakura \u2013 Richmond match was played at Prince Edward Park in Papakura. The scores were level 10\u201310 in the second half when both A Burgess and G Crocker left the field injured leaving Papakura with just 11 players. Richmond went on to win 16\u201310.\nRound 12.\nPrime Minister, Michael Joseph Savage was a guest of the Auckland Rugby League and came to Carlaw Park to watch some of the play. He was accompanied by president John .A. Lee and along with his party was \"entertained at an afternoon tea organised by the ladies\u2019 social committee\". L Cootes of Ponsonby was ordered off for striking a City opponent. In the same match Turi Albert Macpherson broke his leg when he collided with a Ponsonby forward.\nRound 13.\nDuring the Mount Albert \u2013 Marist game Arthur McInnarney and MacLachlan collided while trying to field a kick which allowed Marist to score a try giving them the lead. McInnarney had to leave the field with an injured leg as a result of the collision. In the Richmond game with North Shore six players had to leave the field with injuries. North Shore had to play two short in the second half. Dick Smith and Verdun Scott were amongst those who had to go off, along with Powell. During the week Richmond lost the services of Frank Furnell who transferred to Wellington. He was replaced at fullback by Trevor Bramley.\nRound 15.\nLaurie Mills (aged 20) was concussed in the Richmond \u2013 Manukau game and was taken to hospital. He would later be killed in action during World War 2. In the Marist game with City Bob Banham went off injured in the first half for City, while Jackie Rata and Jackson went off in the second half. Remarkably in the North Shore v Papakura match the referee was Ted Mincham who had spent the first half of the season playing for Mount Albert seniors. He would surely have been one of the only players ever to play and referee in the same competition during a season. He would however play senior football again for Richmond during the war years.\nRound 16.\nGordon Midgley who had returned from New Zealand's tour of Australia weeks earlier scored four tries for Marist on the wing in their 32-4 win over Richmond. The win gave them a four point lead over Mount Albert for the championship. Richard Shadbolt was sent off for Mount Albert during the first half of their match with Manukau. They also lost Charles Dunne and A MacLachlan through injuries meaning that for nearly 30 minutes they had to play with just 10 men.\nRound 17.\nThe Auckland match against Canterbury was played on the same day at Carlaw Park with the club matches providing the curtain-raisers. Richmond and Manukau did not play on the day and the Auckland team was made exclusively from their teams. In the match between Mount Albert and City, Jack Tristram and Bob Banham were ordered off from each team respectively after an incident between them.\nRound 18.\nBy virtue of their win over Newton, Marist claimed the Fox memorial title for 1938. Roy Hardgrave made an appearance for Mount Albert after recently returning to Auckland from his time playing professionally in England and France.\nRoope Rooster (knockout competition).\nFriendly match.\nNorth Shore and Papakura met at Prince Edward Park in a 'friendly match' which did not count towards the Roope Rooster competition.\nRound 2.\nIn the match between North Shore and Marist, Hugh Simpson (North Shore), Ken Finlayson (Marist), and Joe Woods (Marist) were all sent from the field.\nPhelan Shield.\nRound 1.\nIn the Mount Albert match with Marist, Joseph Gunning and Richard Shadbolt were both sent off for Mount Albert and William Grotte was sent off for Marist. Jack Donovan refereed the Mt Albert v Marist game, with his brother Phil scoring a try for Marist in their 6-5 loss.\nRound 2.\nIn addition to the 2 Phelan Shield matches Marist played Ponsonby in a practice game on the No. 2 field as preparation for their match against the touring Eastern Suburbs side, while Ponsonby was still in the Phelan Shield and preparing for their semi-final match. Marist won 20 points to 14. Robert Marshall, the wicket keeper for the Auckland representative cricket side, scored a try in Mt Albert's loss to Manukau.\nStormont Shield (champion of champions).\nDuring the match 21 year old Maurice Potter of the Richmond side was concussed and taken to hospital though his condition was reported to not be serious. He was replaced by Frank Furnell who had returned from Wellington.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, Phelan Shield and Stormont Shield matches which all first grade sides were eligible for competing in (provided they avoided elimination from the knock out competitions). The top point scorer for the third consecutive season was John Anderson with 82. Jack Hemi (Manukau) only 2 points behind, with and J McInnnes (Papakura) 2 further back with 78, while Jack Smith had 60, all from the boot. Anderson, Hemi, and Smith all went on the New Zealand tour of Australia mid-season which meant they missed 6 Fox Memorial games so their point totals were significantly below than what they would have been.\nSenior reserve competitions.\nThe early round results were not reported while several later rounds also only had sporadic reporting. Richmond and Mount Albert were tied after 18 rounds necessitating a final between the two teams which Richmond won by 16 points to 10.\nNorton Cup results.\nIn the opening round match between Mount Albert and Ponsonby at Grey Lynn, Norman Drew fractured his ankle.\nSenior B grade competitions.\nSharman Cup results.\nThe round 1 match between Otahuhu and Point Chevalier at Walker Park was called off by the referee with Otahuhu in the lead by 25 points to 13. The match was awarded to Otahuhu with Point Chevalier's approval. Earlier in the season the Point Chevalier club had seen floodlights added to its ground at Walker Park for the first time. Manukau entered a team after round 1 but they defaulted their round 2 match against Ellerslie (this match was then removed from the records) and then withdrew from the competition.\nOtahuhu won the competition and their final round match was against Green Lane (who finished runner up) at Carlaw Park on July 16. The match was a curtain-raiser to the Auckland \u2013 New Zealand match. Not all of the results were reported in the newspapers however at the conclusion of the competition the Auckland Star reported that the teams finished on the following competition points: Otahuhu 19, Green Lane 14, Ellerslie 12, Point Chevalier 7, Northcote 6, R.V. 2.\nWalmsley Shield (knockout competition).\nDue to the amount of time left in the season following the conclusion of the Sharman Cup it was decided to play a full home and away competition for the Walmsley Shield. Very few results were reported and Point Chevalier dropped out of the competition after round 6. Ellerslie won the competition.\nOther club matches.\nManukau v South Auckland XIII.\nIn a preseason match Manukau played a South Auckland XIII at Waikaraka Park in Onehunga. Neither George Nepia or Jack Hemi played in the match but Manukau won a \"fast and interesting contest\".\nLower Grades.\nRichmond won the Davis Shield for the most championship points in all grades which they had won for several consecutive years, while Otahuhu won the Tracy Inglis trophy for most points in the junior grades.\nIt was noted by the chairman of the schools\u2019 committee, Mr. A.E. Stanley at the end of the season at the final control board meeting that \"eight years ago there were seven school teams in Auckland, while in the season just closed there were 41 teams in the three grades\".\nSchoolboys\nA schoolboy gala was held at Carlaw Park on the 22nd of October. Competing teams in the 7-a-side tournament were St. Patricks, George Court's (2), Ellerslie (2), Richmond, Ponsonby, Green Lane, Point Chevalier, Balmoral, Northcote, Manukau, Newton, Glenora, and Marist. The team from Ponsonby won the knockout competition when they defeated Ellerslie in the final.

The most improved 7-a-side player was named as J. Stackpole from Newton. The J. Gedye Cup went to S. Callagher of Richmond, while D. White of Ponsonby won the Don Cleverley Medal. The Marist team was presented with medals by Mr. C.L.M. Green, while J. Scott of the North Shore side was presented with the Sam Dickie Cup for goalkicking in the intermediate grade.\nThe results shown in the tables are based on scores reported in the New Zealand Herald, Auckland Star and Franklin Times so are very incomplete as many clubs did not submit results.\n3rd Grade.\nThe 3rd Grade was split into 2 sections due to the number of teams. North Shore won section 1 and Richmond won section 2. Both teams played a home and away series to decide the overall 3rd grade champion with Richmond winning the first match 8-2 and the second match 8-3 to take the title on August 6 and August 13 respectively. Northcote and Richmond met in the final of the knockout competition on September 10 but the result was not reported in the newspapers. Ultimately Richmond finished the season winning 16 from 16 including their knockout matches, scoring 452 points and conceding just 52.\n4th Grade (Hospital Cup).\nIt was decided to substitute the Hospital Cup for the fourth grade championship with the George Gillett Cup which had been presented to the league by George A. Gillett earlier in the season. City won the championship. Otahuhu won the knockout competition with an 11-7 win on September 10 over City. It was unclear when the knockout competition began as all teams continued to play matches until the end of the season.\n5th Grade (Endean Shield).\nMount Albert won the championship with a 14-0 win over Green Lane on September 10. Green Lane met Richmond in the knockout competition final which ran from September 10 to October 8 but the result was not reported. \n6th Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nPonsonby won the championship. On August 20 Ponsonby beat Richmond 7-3 but the match was ordered to be replayed. Ponsonby won the match on September 3 and then got to play Marist in a playoff for the title. Ponsonby won easily by 18 points to 0. On June 11 Richmond beat Avondale 6-3 however they had fielded an over age player. The player in question had provided their younger brothers birth certificate and had been registered by the ARL. Richmond argued that the ARL was complicit if they were. The league eventually decided to replay the game. The replay was on August 6 and Richmond won 8-4 after having won the original match 6-3. Richmond won the knockout competition when they beat Otahuhu 32 to 8 on September 17.\n7th Grade (Myers Cup).\nRichmond won the championship and the knockout title with a 15-5 win over City on August 20.

Newton had finished runner up in the championship. St Patricks School on Wellington Street in Freemans Bay entered two teams in the competition after 5 weeks under the umbrella of the City Rovers club which was situated in the area.\nJunior championship (Robert Reid Memorial Shield).\nPonsonby won the competition when they beat Ellerslie in the final on October 22. Not all results were reported so their exact numbers in the standings are incomplete. St Patricks School on Wellington Street in Freemans Bay entered a side on August 20. Napier Street school also entered a team on August 20 but they only played a small number of fixtures and lost 2 games by default.\nRepresentative Fixtures.\nNorth Island v South Island (inter-island match).\nBrian Riley was initially named to play for the North Island side but as he was unable to get leave from work to potentially tour Australia if selected he was replaced in the North Island side.\nProbables v Possibles.\nThe Possibles team led 19\u20130 at halftime and so the selectors switched the forwards and three players who had started in the Possibles side scored points for the Probables in the second half (Bert Leatherbarrow, John Anderson, and Bill McNeight).\nAuckland M\u0101ori (Tamaki) v Auckland P\u0101keh\u0101.\nDuring the match 24 year old Joseph Alva Gunning received a kick to the head and went to Auckland Hospital with concussion. It was said that his condition was not serious however the New Zealand Herald reported two weeks later that he had only recently been discharged from hospital with the intention of playing in the upcoming weekend match for Mount Albert though he ultimately didn't return until their July 2 match. Ted Brimble, the Auckland M\u0101ori first five-eighth injured his leg in the first half and was replaced by Mihaka Panapa.\nAuckland M\u0101ori (T\u0101maki) representative season.\nAuckland M\u0101ori only played one match during the season. The club competition ran much longer than it had in previous seasons and the New Zealand side went on a mid season tour of Australia meaning that there were relatively few opportunities for representative matches. On June 6 they played an Auckland P\u0101keh\u0101 side at Carlaw Park and won 26 to 21.\nT\u0101maki (Auckland M\u0101ori) representative matches played and scorers.\nMihaka Panapa came on to replace Ted Brimble in their match just before half time after Brimble injured his leg.\nSenior grade registration and transfers.\nOn March 3 the following players were registered: Ian Mackenzie (ex King Country), and H.P.S.

He was a burgess of Glasgow. In 1627 he painted the globe and the weather vane of the steeple at the Glasgow Tolbooth.\nJenkins redecorated the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle in 1628, refreshing painted decoration from 1594 inside and out. Within the chapel, a painted frieze with festoons of leaves and fruit and (now blank) medallions, is his work. The frieze was described in 1628 as a \"course of panels, arms, and badges conform to the roof and border\". The painted freize is visible (with some restoration) within the chapel, and external paintwork has left discernible traces and shadows on the courtyard fa\u00e7ade.\nMaterials bought for Jenkin and his team of painters at Stirling in 1617 included, red lead, florey (a kind of indigo), umber, linseed oil, skins for making glue size, butter, and jars called \"pigs\". In 1628 he was bought chalk, oil, and colours.\nJenkin made two contracts for painting the rooms of the palace of Stirling Castle and the Chapel Royal in 1628. On the exterior of the palace he gilded and painted the royal initials and crowns, and painted the window grills or yetts with red oil paint. Details on the gatehouse and its coat of arms were painted the same. Inside, the window shutters were painted, and he restored the existing painted borders and royal ciphers. He marbled the chimneys. The queen's bedchamber was to be \"fair wrought with arms and antiques\" according to the ceiling details. He also painted the rooms and passages on the floor above, including two rooms for the Duke of Buckingham which were above the king's bedchamber, accessible via a private stair. The upstairs rooms were painted gray and white, with imitation panelling in the passages. Nothing survives of this work, although nearly all the rooms mentioned in Jenkin's contract survive.\nFalkland Palace.\nJenkin rode from Stirling to paint and gild three great carved oak heraldic panels for the exterior of the gate house of Falkland Palace in 1629. The wooden armorials today are 19th-century replacements.\nKinneil House.\nA vaulted first-floor room at Kinneil House, known as the Arbour Room, was redecorated around the year 1620 for James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton and his wife Ann Cunningham. Her \"shakefork\" and the rabbit supporters of Cunningham heraldry can still be seen. This painting was almost certainly the work of Valentine Jenkins, who worked for the family elsewhere.\nHeraldic manuscript.\nThe 19th-century writers on genealogy and heraldry R. R. Stodart and G. Harvey Johnston refer to a manuscript known as the \"Valentine Jenkins' Collection\" or the \"Armes\" of \"Vallentyn Jenkyns\" in connection with family of Hamilton of Innerwick. Compiled between 1640 and 1645, the manuscript was later owned and used by another 17th-century Edinburgh painter and herald, Joseph Stacie (1625\u20131686), and is now held by the Lord Lyon office in Edinburgh. Stacie, originally from Nottingham, also acquired an armorial manuscript compiled by James Workman and another from the widow of John Sawers (National Library of Scotland Adv. MS 31.4.4).\nThere were several painters at work in Scotland at the time, and Andrew Home was recorded as Jenkins' assistant at Stirling. Some decorative painters based in London worked in Scotland, including Edward Arthur, George Crawford, and Matthew Goodrick.", "Goslarer Kaiserring\n\nSince 1975, the Goslarer Kaiserring award has been given, by the city of Goslar, to a distinguished international artist of modern and contemporary art.

It is found in the Indo-West Pacific region.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Cirrhitus pinnulatus\" was first formally described in 1801 as \"Labrus pinnulatus\" by the German naturalist and explorer Johann Reinhold Forster from Tahiti. Forster's manuscript description was the basis of the description published in 1801 by Johann Gottlob Schneider in his and Marcus Elieser Bloch's \"Systema Ichthyologiae\", although \"Catalog of Fishes\" attributes the name to Forster. When the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de created the genus \"Cirrhitus\" he placed a single species within it, his own \"Cirrhitus maculatus\" which was later shown to be a synonym of Forster's \"Labrus pinnulatus\", under the name \"C. maculatus\" this species is the type species of its genus. The specific name \"pinnulatus\" means \"pinnulated\", perhaps a reference to the fringe of cirri on the rear margin of the front nostril.\nThree subspecies of this species are currently recognised:\nIn 1950 Leonard Peter Schultz recognised three species from the widespread species \"C. pinnulatus\", \"C. spilotoceps\" from the Red Sea, \"C. pinnulatus\" from the wider Indo-Pacific region except for Hawaii and \"C. maculosus\" from Hawaii and the Johnston Atoll. John Ernest Randall in his 1963 review of the family Cirrhitidae did not recognise these species but treated them as subspecies. \"Catalog of Fishes\" recognises \"C. spilotoceps\" as a valid species and treats \"C. maculosus\" as a subspecies of \"C. pinnulatus\", while \"FishBase\" treats these names as synonyms of \"C. pinnulatus\". It may be that records of \"C. pinnulatus\" \"sensu lato\" from the east African coast and possibly elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, refer to \"C. spilotoceps\".\nDescription.\n\"Cirrhitus pinnulatus\" has a body which has a standard length of roughly three times its depth. The head has a short, blunt snout and a large mouth which extends back as far as the rear edge of the eye which has a low bony ridge above it. The mouth has two types of teeth, an outer row of canines and an inner row of villiform teeth. There are also teeth on the centre and sides of the roof of the mouth. They have a fringe of cirri on the posterior margin of the anterior nostril. The upper margin of the preopercle has fine serrations. The continuous dorsal fin has 10 spines and 11 soft rays, there is a deep incision between spiny and soft rayed parts of the fin and a tassel of cirri near tip of each spine. The anal fin has 3 spines and 6 soft rays&gt; The caudal fin gently rounded and the pectoral fins do not extend as far as the tips of pelvic fins, The pectoral fin rays number 14 with the lower 7 unbranched and robust. This species attains a maximum total length of , although is more typical. The overall colour of this hawkfish is brown with white blotches and irregular reddish-brown spots on the body, The head is marked with sinuous reddish-orange lines and spots. There is a dark saddle-like blotch on the dorsal part of the caudal peduncle.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Cirrhitus pinnulatus\" has a wide Indo-West Pacific distribution being found from the Red Sea and the east African coast south as far as Port Alfred in South Africa east across the Indian Ocean and into the Pacific where it reaches as far east as Hawaii, south to New Caledonia and Australia and north to the Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan. In Australia it is found at Ningaloo Reef and Scott Reef in Western Australia, Cartier Reef in the Timor Sea and from Lizard Island to Escape Reef on the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, it also occurs at Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It occurs at depths between but is typically found at depths of less than . This species is found in exposed areas such as the surge zone on the seaward sides of reefs and along rocky coastlines.\nBiology.\n\"Cirrhitus pinnulatus\" is a nocturnal species. It is a predator which mainly feeds on crabs. It will also feed on other crustaceans, small fishes, sea urchins or brittle stars. They are pelagic spawners, the pair ascend into the water column to release their gametes. They are likely to be protogynous hermaphrodites but further study is needed to confirm this.\nFisheries.\nCirrhatus pinnulatus is taken by subsistence fisheries and is normally caught from shore using hook and line, the catch is sold fresh.", "Matej Rudan\n\nMatej Rudan (born 21 March 2001) is a Croatian professional basketball player who currently plays for KK Spartak Subotica of the ABA League and KLS.\nEarly career.\nRudan started to play basketball with KK Omi\u0161-Cagalj Tours Galeb.

They had one daughter, Gemma (1907-1994), who became a goldsmith, and two sons: Stefan (1911-1984), who was also an architect, and , a well-known sculptor.\nThrough his brother-in-law, the psychiatrist , he came into contact with an intellectual group that included the historian, Friedrich Wolters and the lawyer, . They, in turn, introduced him to the \"George-Kreis\", centered around the poet, Stefan George, of which he became an enthusiastic member, as did his children. In 1927, Gemma would marry Wolters, who was three years older than her father.\nIn 1915, upon the recommendation of Bruno Paul, he was chosen from seventy-six applicants to become director of the Handwerkerschule (Crafts School) in Halle. He immediately began to reorganize the school according to the principles of the Deutscher Werkbund, hiring several new instructors and beginning a new program for textiles. He was also influenced by the ideas of the Georeg-Kreis. In 1922, the school moved to Burg Giebichenstein, its name was changed to the \"State-Municipal School of Applied Arts\" and it became a center for the Bauhaus movement.\nThiersch endeavored to help design the area around the Burg. In 1926, he and Gerhard Marcks worked together on designing the new over the Saale, which is now one of the city's landmarks. That same year, he created plans for the new Leipzig/Halle Airport, but only the main hangar was built. He had more success with projects for stage design, of which he created almost forty for theatres in Halle, Leipzig and G\u00f6ttingen. From 1921 to 1926, he was also Director of the . While there, he acquired paintings by Emil Nolde, Franz Marc and Oskar Kokoschka.\nIn hopes of working full-time as an architect, he accepted the chair of \"spatial art\" at the University of Hanover, and was succeeded at the Burg by Marcks. However, only a few weeks after arriving there, he died suddenly, at the age of forty-nine. A street in Halle was later named after him.", "Triver\n\nTriver was a Spanish car brand made by Construcciones Acorazadas SA in Bilbao (also known as Automotores Triver) from 1953 to 1962. Construcciones Acorazadas SA ceased business in 1983 after devastating floods.\nCompany history.\nThe company Construcciones Acorazadas SA was located in Bilbao, Spain. Its primary business was manufacturing safes and metal furnishings. From this, it branched into making stationary motors, pumps, and a diesel- or oil-powered 24cc 2-stroke motor for bicycles, called the \"Fraso\". In 1948, the company obtained a license to manufacture small cars. The license was ratified in 1953 by the Vizcaya Industry Delegation and required the company to produce at least 50 units.\nThe cars, brand-named \"Triver\" by Construcciones Acorazadas SA, were designed in 1953 by Antonio de Sope\u00f1a e Irabien, the company CEO, who was also an industrial engineer. Development commenced in 1954, and production in 1957. Production ended in 1960 after around 75 cars were made. Only one vehicle remains in existence.\nDevelopment of the Triver.\nIn 1953, a four-wheel prototype was made. The two rear wheels were spaced together. Its body was handmade from 2 or 3\u00a0mm-thick sheet metal. It had no rear window. Motive power was from a proprietary EMB-type two-cylinder opposed 339cc engine located just in front of the two rear wheels. Initial tests of the prototype were unsatisfactory, forcing significant redesign work and delaying production.\nVehicles.\nRana (prototype).\nThe first model was a tricycle, with the single wheel at the rear (there is disagreement between sources as to whether or not this was the case). An air-cooled two-cylinder two-stroke engine, which was manufactured by Construcciones Acorazadas SA under the type designation EMB as a boxer engine, provided the drive. The 60\u00a0mm bore and 60\u00a0mm stroke resulted in a displacement of 339\u00a0cm\u00b3; the power was 14\u00a0hp. The design-related maximum speed was specified as 60\u00a0km/h. With a wheelbase of 160\u00a0cm, the vehicle length was 265\u00a0cm and the vehicle height was 137\u00a0cm. Only one car, the prototype, was built to this specification.\nRana 500.\nThe production model from 1955\u201362 had four wheels, but outwardly resembled the tricycle. The two-cylinder engine from Hispano Villiers had a displacement of 500\u00a0cm\u00b3 and developed 14 to 16\u00a0hp. The top speed was 78\u00a0km/h. The track width was 126\u00a0cm at the front and only 54\u00a0cm at the rear. Despite the shorter wheelbase of 154\u00a0cm, the vehicle was slightly longer than the tricycle, at 267\u00a0cm. The width was 146\u00a0cm, the height 140\u00a0cm. 75 of these were made.\nCervato (prototype).\nIn 1959, work began on a new prototype, the Cervato, powered by the same 500cc two-stroke motor as the Rana. It had a wider rear track and better capacity for four passengers than the Rana. Its bodywork was made of a mixture of fiberglass and plastic resin. The luggage compartment was separate from the passenger compartment, being front-engined. It had heating, ventilation, an anti-fog system, adjustable front seats, and a radio. The gasoline and oil tanks were separate, incorporating an automatic mixing device. Due to an economic downturn, work on this project ceased in 1960, and by 1962, all car production by Construcciones Acorazadas SA ended.", "Heino Eelsalu\n\nHeino Eelsalu (8 May 1930 \u2013 26 July 1998) was an Estonian astronomer and science historian.\nEelsalu was born in Tallinn in 1930.

The plants are grown in the Philippines as part of a sustainable forestry project in Catanduanes. Bananatex was developed and is distributed by the Swiss canvas goods company QWSTION and is used in the company's own products as well as in other companies' manufactured goods. Bananatex was developed to have better wear characteristics than cotton while being more sustainable. It is less durable than synthetics like Cordura, and can biodegrade. Bananatex is sold in a range of colours and is available with or without a natural beeswax waterproof coating.\nDevelopment.\nBananatex was developed over three years by Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland-based fashion company QWSTION, which was founded in 2008 to research renewable materials to replace synthetic textiles. The company was created to address environmental, economic and social sustainability issues of petroleum-based synthetic materials in the textile manufacturing industry. Bananatex was created in collaboration with a yarn spinning company in Tainan, Taiwan.\nProduction process.\nUnlike cotton and some other natural fibres like cotton Abac\u00e1 plants require no pesticides, herbicides or irrigation. This allows mixed-species, organic plantations in areas which were monoculture oil palm plantations, and in deforested rainforest cut down for lumber. Growing abac\u00e1 plants can reduce erosion, increase biodiversity and enrich the soil. This is accomplished by interplanting abac\u00e1 with other plant species and by allowing discarded abac\u00e1 leaves to decompose and return their nutrients to the soil.\nCultivation.\nThe Abac\u00e1 plants are grown in Catanduanes in the Philippine highlands without the use of water or pesticides. The banana plant is harvested up to three times per year. \nProducts using Bananatex.\nSeveral companies use Banantex in their products:\nMaterial properties.\nThe fibre of Abac\u00e1 hemp has many different industrial applications due to its extremely high mechanical strength and length of 2 to 3 metres. These mechanical properties make Bananatex strong and durable, while also being soft, lightweight and flexible.", "Elgar Baeza\n\nElgar Baeza (8 November 1939 \u2013 8 September 2020) was an Uruguayan footballer.

There are 90 graves in the cemetery. Also on the territory of the cemetery, there is a monument in the form of a black cross.\nHistory.\nAccording to Tair Behbudov, a historian who studies the fate of German prisoners of war who arrived in Azerbaijan, about 42 thousand German prisoners of war arrived in Baku. As noted by another historian, Javid Bagirzadeh, the dispatch of the German prisoners of war to Azerbaijan consisted of two stages: the first group of German prisoners of war arrived in the republic in 1944, the second in 1945. The second group of prisoners of war arrived in the\nearly 1945 from the central regions of Russia. Wounded prisoners of war were sent to Baku, some of whom later did not survived due to their injures. Many of the prisoners of war were later placed in other regions of the republic.\nIn Baku, the prisoners of war participated in the construction of buildings such as the Government House, the residential building of the Buzovnyneft trust, the actors residential house on Bakikhanov Street, the Bolshoy Dvor residential area complex on Stroiteley Avenue, etc. In particular, in the construction of the Government House, according to Behbudov, about 150 prisoners of war were involved, performing the roles of civil engineers, carpenters, stone cutters, facade craftsmen, etc. According to the archive data, that Behbudov relies on, the prisoners walked from the prison, which was located in the Black City, towards the construction site, and returned in the evening.\nSome of the prisoners of war who died in Baku were buried in the Yasamal region.

There are 55 active coal-fired power stations with a total capacity of 21 gigawatts (GW). In 2023 coal imports for electricity generation cost 3.7 billion USD.\nAir pollution from coal-fired power stations is damaging public health, and it is estimated that a coal phase-out by 2030 instead of by the 2050s would save over 100,000 lives. Flue gas emission limits were improved in 2020, but data from mandatory reporting of emission levels is not made public. Turkey has not ratified the Gothenburg Protocol, which limits fine dust polluting other countries. As of 2023 official health impact assessment is not done in Turkey.\nTurkey's coal is almost all low calorie lignite, but government policy supports its continued use. In contrast, Germany is closing lignite-fired stations under 150 MW. Drought in Turkey is frequent, but thermal power stations use significant amounts of water.\nCoal-fired power stations are the largest source of greenhouse gas, at about a tonne each year per person, which is about the world average. Coal-fired stations emit over 1\u00a0kg of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt hour generated, over twice that of gas power. Academics suggest that in order to reach Turkey's target of carbon neutrality by 2053, coal power should be phased out by the mid-2030s. In January 2023 the National Energy Plan was published: it forecast a capacity increase to 24.3 GW by 2035, including 1.7 GW more by 2030. However by 2024 it was obvious that no new coal power stations would be built, although \u00c7elikler Holding still want to add units to Af\u015fin Elbistan A, which is the only proposal for new unabated coal power in the OECD. The national plan forecasts coal generation decreasing but capacity payments continuing for flexible and baseload power. In 2024 Turkey is burning more coal for electricity than any country in the European Union.\nEnergy policy.\nEnergy strategy includes increasing the share of not just renewable energy in Turkey, but also other local energy resources to support the country's development and to reduce dependence on energy imports. Turkey has not ratified the Gothenburg Protocol on emissions ceilings for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Earlier in 2021 Turkey ratified the Paris Agreement to limit climate change, but policy was still to increase domestic coal share in the energy mix, and planned increases in coal power were forecast to increase emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions are pledged to peak by 2038 at the latest.\nGeneration.\nCoal-fired power stations generate approximately one third of the nation's electricity: in 2020 made up of 62 TWh from imported coal and 44 TWh from local coal (almost all lignite). there are 54 licensed coal-fired power stations with a total capacity in December 2022 of 21.8111\u00a0gigawatts (GW). There is no unlicensed coal power. The average thermal efficiency of Turkey's coal-fired power stations is 36%. Generation fell in 2021 due to the high cost of imported coal (over $70 /MWh). Emba Hunutlu was the last coal plant to be built and started up in 2022. Shanghai Electric Power said it would be China's largest ever direct investment in Turkey. However, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature, it could not make a profit if it was not subsidized. Af\u015fin-Elbistan C and further new coal-fired power stations will probably not be constructed, due to public opposition, court cases, and the risk of them becoming stranded assets. Typical thermal efficiencies are 39%, 42% and 44% for subcritical, supercritical and ultra supercritical power stations.\nIn 2022 the average age of a coal power station was 17 years, as much of the operational fleet was built in the 21st century. There was oversupply of generating capacity and a drop in demand in 2020, and a quarter of power stations were estimated to be cashflow negative. Solar generation fits better with consumption, as annual peak electricity demand is on summer afternoons, due to air conditioning.\nGermany is closing lignite-fired stations under 150\u00a0MW. Neighbouring Greece is closing down all its lignite-fueled power stations.\nYunus Emre power station was completed in 2020, but had only generated 700 hours of power to the grid by 2022. As coal in the local area is unsuitable for its boilers it became a stranded asset: it was bought by Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar Holding (Y\u0131ld\u0131zlar SSS Holding A.\u015e. not to be confused with Y\u0131ld\u0131z Holding). In May 2023 Vice President Fuat Oktay said that unit 1 would be restarted in June, and by mid-August about 60 GWh had been sent to the grid.\nWith a few exceptions stations smaller than 200\u00a0MW provide both electricity and heat, often to factories, whereas almost all those larger than 200\u00a0MW just generate electricity. Companies owning large amounts of coal power include Eren, \u00c7elikler, Aydem, \u0130\u00c7DA\u015e, Anadolu Birlik (via Konya Sugar) and Diler.\nFlexibility.\nTurkey plans to substantially increase the contribution of solar and wind power to its mix of generation. Cost-effective system operation with a high proportion of these intermittent generation sources requires system flexibility, where other sources of generation can be ramped up or down promptly in response to changes in intermittent generation. However, conventional coal-fired generation may not have the flexibility required to accommodate a large proportion of solar and wind power. Retrofitting to increase the ramp-up rate to reach full load in 1 hour, and lower minimum generation to half max may be possible for about 9 GW (just under half) of installed capacity. Lignite-fired power stations are less able to ramp up and down.\nCoal industry.\nGovernment policy supports continued generation from lignite (brown coal) because it is mined locally, whereas almost all hard coal (anthracite and bituminous coal) is imported. In 2020, 51 million tonnes (83%) of lignite and 22 million tonnes (55%) of hard coal was burnt in power stations.\nIn 2020 Anadolu Birlik Holding, \u00c7elikler Holding, Ciner Holding, Diler Holding, Eren Holding, Aydem, IC \u0130\u00e7ta\u015f, Kolin and Oda\u015f, were substantially involved in electricity generation from coal.\nLocally mined lignite.\nPower stations burning lignite tend to be near local coalmines, such as Elbistan, because Turkish lignite's calorific value is less than 12.5\u00a0MJ/kg (and Afsin Elbistan lignite less than 5\u00a0MJ/kg, which is a quarter of typical thermal coal), and about 90% has lower heat value under 3,000 kcal/kg, so is not worth transporting. According to energy analyst Haluk Direskeneli because of the low quality of Turkish lignite large amounts of supplementary fuel oil is used in lignite fired power stations. The emission factor is about 105 t/TJ.(cite 2023 NIR page 73 table 3.18)\nImported coal.\nTo minimize transport costs, power stations burning imported coal are usually located on the coast; with clusters in \u00c7anakkale and Zonguldak provinces and around Iskenderun Bay. Coal with up to 3% sulphur and minimum 5,400 kcal/kg can be imported, with capacity to burn about 25 million tons a year. In 2023 over half of thermal coal imports were from Russia. According to thinktank Ember, , building new wind and solar power is cheaper than running existing coal power stations which depend on imported coal.\nAir pollution.\nAir pollution is a significant environmental and public health problem in Turkey, and has been for decades. A 1996 court order to shut 3 polluting power stations was not enforced. Levels of air pollution have been recorded above the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in 51 out of 81 provinces. As for long range air pollution, Turkey has not ratified the Gothenburg Protocol which covers PM 2.5 (fine particles), and reporting under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution has been criticized as incomplete.\nNew flue gas emission limits were introduced in January 2020, resulting in five 20th century power stations being shut down that month because they did not meet the new limits. They were all re-licensed after improvements in 2020, such as new flue gas filters, but the effectiveness of the improvements is being questioned, as expenditure may not have been sufficient. There is not enough data regarding modern filters, due to many government ambient air monitoring points both being defective and not measuring fine particulate matter. Fine particulates (PM2.5), are the most dangerous pollutant but have no legal ambient limit.\nThe \"Industry Related Air Pollution Control Regulation\" says that flue-gas stacks must be at least 10m from the ground and 3m above the roof. Larger power stations must measure local pollutants vented into the atmosphere from the smokestack and report them to the Environment Ministry but, unlike the EU, they are not required to publish the data. In 2022 academics called for better monitoring and stricter emission limits.\nCoal contributes to air pollution in big cities. Air pollution from some large coal-fired power stations is publicly visible in Sentinel satellite data. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that old coal-fired power stations are emitting dangerous levels of fine particulates: so it recommends reducing particulate emissions by retrofitting or closing old coal-fired power plants. Although the Turkish government receives reports of measurements of air pollution from the smokestacks of individual coal-fired power stations, it does not publish the reports, unlike the EU. There is a pollutant release and transfer register, but as of September 2024 no years are publicly searchable because it is not yet technically complete, and it is not known what exemptions will be granted.(see FAQ).\nFlue gas emission limits in milligrams per cubic metre (mg/Nm3) are:\nThe limits are laxer than the EU Industrial Emissions Directive and the SO2 limit for large coal-fired power plants in other countries, such as India at 100\u00a0mg/m3, and China at 35\u00a0mg/m3.\nGreenhouse gas emissions.\nCoal-fired power stations emit over 1\u00a0kg of carbon dioxide for every kilowatt hour generated, over twice that of gas-fired power stations. Turkey's coal-fired power stations are the largest contributor to the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Production of public heat and electricity emitted 138 megatonnes of equivalent (e) in 2019, mainly through coal burning.\nBecause lignite quality varies greatly, to estimate the carbon dioxide emissions from a particular power station, the net calorific value of the lignite it burnt must be reported to the government. But this is not published, unlike some other countries. However public information from space-based measurements of carbon dioxide by Climate TRACE is expected to reveal individual large power stations in 2022, and smaller ones by GOSAT-GW in 2023 and possibly in 2025 by Sentinel-7.\nA 2020 study estimated that fitting carbon capture and storage to a power station burning Turkish lignite would increase the cost of its electricity by over 50%. In 2021 Turkey targeted net zero carbon emissions by 2053. After the Paris Agreement on limiting climate change was ratified in 2021 many environmental groups called for the government to set a target year for coal phase-out.\nCoal combustion emitted over 150Mt of CO2 in total in 2018, about a third of Turkey's greenhouse gas. Emissions from individual power plants over 20 MW are measured. Life-cycle emissions of Turkish coal-fired power stations are over 1\u00a0kg CO2eq per kilowatt-hour. \n coal mine methane remains an environmental challenge, because removing it from working underground mines is a safety requirement but if vented to the atmosphere it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nWater consumption.\nBecause Turkey's lignite-fired power stations have to be very close to their mines to avoid excessive lignite transport costs, they are mostly inland (see map of active coal-fired power stations in Turkey). Coal power stations may require a large quantity of water for the circulating water plant and coal washing if required. In Turkey, fresh water is used because of the locations of the plants. Between 600 and 3000 cubic metres of water is used per GWh generated, much more than solar and wind power. This intensive use has led to shortages in nearby villages and farmlands.\nAsh.\nThe mineral residue that remains from burning coal is known as coal ash, and contains toxic substances that may pose a health risk to workers in coal-fired power stations and people living or working near Turkey's large coal ash dams. A 2021 report from \"\u0130klim De\u011fi\u015fikli\u011fi Politika ve Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Derne\u011fi\" (Climate Change Policy and Research Association) said that 2020s environmental law was being evaded by the repeated granting of less stringent 1 year temporary operating licenses, and said that coal ash storage permit criteria (inspections by universities) were unclear, so some power stations were not properly storing unhealthy coal ash . They said that some inspections may be insufficient and summarized inspection reports as:\nTaxes, subsidies and incentives.\nAround the year 2000 government incentives were offered to build cogeneration power stations (such as autoproducers in factories but not connected to the grid), much small cogeneration was built in industrial parks or in sugar factories. About 20 of these small autoproducers were operating by 2021 but there is no list publicly available as they are not connected to the grid and no longer require licences. Because of its low calorific value lignite-fired electricity costs more to generate than in other European countries (except for Greece).\nThe companies which built most recent stations: Cengiz, Kolin, Limak and Kalyon;\u00a0are\u00a0mainly in the\u00a0construction\u00a0rather than the energy sector; and some say they took on lignite-power at a loss to be politically favoured for other construction projects.\nIn 2023 350.org estimated total coal power assets at 20 billion USD and said that all local insurance was underwritten internationally. A 2024 report from the Coal Producers Association gave examples of 13% interest rates, although the central bank rate for lira was 45% to 50%. This is because the Association assumes borrowing in dollars and getting a power purchase agreement in dollars.\nIn 2019 large lignite-burning stations were subsidized with capacity payments totalling over 1 billion lira (US$ million, which was over half of total capacity payments), and in 2020 over 1.2 billion lira (US$ million). In 2021 four power stations burning a mixture of lignite and imported coal also received capacity payments. This capacity mechanism has been criticised by some economists, as they say it encourages strategic capacity withholding, with a study of 2019 data showing that a 1% increase in the electricity price correlated with a 1-minute increase in length of power station generation failures. There is also a market clearing price cap of 2,000 lira(about US$ in 2021)/MWh. These economists say that auctions of firm capacity (this is done in some other countries), with a financial penalty if not delivered, would be a better mechanism. 23 coal-fired power stations are eligible for capacity mechanism payments.\nSome electricity from these stations is purchased by the state-owned electricity company at a guaranteed price of US$50\u201355/MWh until the end of 2027. Imported coal is taxed at US$70 per tonne minus the price of coal on the international market. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism could push coal-power after gas in the merit order: in other words it could become more expensive.\nCapacity payments.\nUnlike new solar and wind power in Turkey's electricity market, these were not decided by reverse auction but fixed by the government, and energy demand management is not eligible. Subsidy continues in 2020 and 13 coal fired power stations received January payments. The Chamber of Engineers () has called for the capacity mechanism to be scrapped.\nPhase-out.\nIn 2019, the OECD said that energy and climate policies that are not aligned in future may prevent some assets from providing an economic return due to the transition to a low-carbon economy. The average Turkish coal-fired power station is predicted to have higher long-run operating costs than renewables by 2030. The insurance industry is slowly withdrawing from fossil fuels.\nIn 2021 the World Bank said that a plan for a just transition away from coal is needed, and environmentalists say it should be gone by 2030. The World Bank has proposed general objectives and estimated the cost, but has suggested government do far more detailed planning. According to a 2021 study by several NGOs if coal power subsidies were completely abolished and a carbon price introduced at around US$40 (which is lower than the 2021 EU Allowance) then all coal power stations would close down before 2030. According to Carbon Tracker in 2021 $1b of investment on the Istanbul Stock Exchange was at risk of stranding, including $300 m for E\u00dcA\u015e. Turkey has $3.2 billion in loans for its energy transition. Small modular reactors have been suggested to replace coal power. A 2023 study suggests the early 2030s and at the latest 2035 as a practical target for phase-out. A 2024 study says that, although some plants would shutdown due to technological or economic obsolescence, a complete phase out by 2035 would require additional capital expenditure on electricity storage: however the study did not consider demand response or electricity trading with the EU.\nSome energy analysts say old plants should be shut down. Three coal-fired power plants, which are in Mu\u011fla Province, Yata\u011fan, Yenik\u00f6y and Kemerk\u00f6y, are becoming outdated. However, if the plants and associated lignite mines were shut down, about 5000 workers would need funding for early retirement or retraining. There would also be health and environmental benefits, but these are difficult to quantify as very little data is publicly available in Turkey on the local pollution by the plants and mines. Away from Zonguldak mining and the coal-fired power plant employ most working people in Soma district. According to Dr. Co\u015fku \u00c7elik \"coal investments in the countryside have been regarded as an employment opportunity by the rural population\".\nAccording to SwitchCoal a 20 billion dollar investment in converting 10 plants to solar, wind and batteries would make an extra 13 billion dollars profit over 30 years. They assumed no carbon pricing and estimated lignite opex at 1 UScent per kWh. They say this would save 35 megatonnes of emissions a year by installing 15GWp of solar, 8 of wind and 0.7 GW battery.\nIn 2024 thinktank Ember wrote that: \u201cFour of the 38 OECD countries saw coal generation in 2023 fall by less than 30% from its peak: Japan, South Korea, Colombia and Mexico. Only one OECD country \u2013 T\u00fcrkiye \u2013 has not yet passed the peak of coal power, setting a new record for coal generation in 2023.\nT\u00fcrkiye set a new coal generation record in 2023, overtaking Poland to become the second largest coal generator in Europe after Germany, with coal accounting for 37% of its electricity supply (118 TWh). However, coal is not booming in T\u00fcrkiye: it was only 5% higher in 2023 than five years before in 2018. At that time, T\u00fcrkiye was planning the world\u2019s third-largest increase in coal power plants, but these have since been cancelled, avoiding a major increase in coal. Unlocking T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s untapped solar potential can help meet growing demand and replace coal power.\u201d", "Valluvalli\n\nValluvalli is a village in Kottuvalli panchayat in Ernakulam district in the Indian state of Kerala.

Coventry\n\nCameron \"Cam\" James Coventry (born 25 February 1991) is a British-Australian historian and postdoctoral research associate at Federation University Australia. In 2021, he wrote a political and diplomatic history of former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke's secret involvement with the United States of America during the 1970s. In another work, \"Links in the Chain\", he made the first attempt by a historian to comprehensively assess the extent of Australian financial benefit from British slavery.\nEducation and political career.\nCoventry grew up in the village of Stirling, South Australia in the Adelaide Hills. He attended Stirling East Primary School and Prince Alfred College in Adelaide where he was captain of debating, editor of the school yearbook, and won Head of the River. After school Coventry studied at Adelaide Law School. In 2014 Coventry moved to Canberra to work in Senator Nick Xenophon's parliamentary office in the Australian Senate. He spent two years at Parliament, during which time he completed a degree in arts at the Australian National University, where he was educated by historian Frank Bongiorno.\nAcademic career.\nAt the University of New South Wales and the Australian Defence Force Academy Coventry completed a Master of Arts under the direction of political scientist Clinton Fernandes, submitting a dissertation in 2018 called \"The Origins of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security.\" The dissertation was later used by former Justice of the High Court of Australia Michael Kirby in his work. In 2017 he moved to Ballarat and began a PhD in 2019 for which he was awarded the university's stipendiary scholarship. In 2019, \"Links in the Chain: British slavery, South Australia and Victoria\" was published. This work generated debate in Adelaide and his adopted city of Ballarat about place-names honoring beneficiaries of slavery. In 2020 Coventry jointly presented the Annual Lecture of the History Council of South Australia in which he discussed the need to reconsider 'South Australian exceptionalism' in light of its dependence on slave money.\nCoventry wrote an open letter to Ballarat City Council in 2021 denouncing its enclosure of the Ballarat Common that explained its long history and heritage significance. The letter was signed by 13 other scholars including Ian D. Clark. It provoked debate in the local paper, The Courier, about the overdevelopment of Ballarat and the loss of working class heritage. In 2022 the council indicated the creation of a new \"great park\" would be made from a portion of the old common.\nCoventry's PhD thesis, completed in 2023 at Federation University, Ballarat, is the first social history specifically focused on Keynesian economics. He shows that the introduction of the macroeconomic agenda of John Maynard Keynes during the Second World War was unpopular among workers in Australia and the United Kingdom. Coventry's thesis supervisors where the cultural historian Keir Reeves, the economic historian Alex Millmow, the socialist sociologist Jeremy C. A. Smith and the social/military historian Erik Eklund.\nBob Hawke.\nIn June 2021 the \"Australian Journal of Politics and History\" published \"The 'Eloquence' of Robert J. Hawke: United States informer, 1973\u201379,\" which propounded the long-held suspicion that the former Prime Minister, Labor Party leader and ACTU President had collaborated with the United States Government in the 1970s. Coventry's article demonstrated by using documentary evidence that Hawke had handed considerable amounts of inside-information to US officials, undermining the causes he was publicly committed to. Coventry's article also named numerous other informers, including John Ducker, Billy Sneddon, Bill Hayden, Rupert Murdoch, David Combe and Don Willesee. Coventry later said the motivation for undertaking the research of the cables at the National Archives and Records Administration had been his recollections of media reports about the revelations of WikiLeaks which were \"pertinent to the present debate about foreign interference \u2013 in the United States but also Australia.\"\nThe article attracted domestic and international media attention, including the front page of \"The Australian\" newspaper and as the lede weekend article on the \"Guardian Australia\". Within a fortnight the article was the most read article in the Journal's near-seven decade history. Journalist Jeff Sparrow said of Coventry's work: \"Not all of Coventry\u2019s evidence is new. But, assembled as a package, it deals a blow to the Hawke legend. Everyone loves a larrikin. Nobody likes a snitch.\" It was subsequently reported that the publication of the article had prevented Labor Leader, Anthony Albanese, from rebranding himself as Australia's next Hawke-style consensus politician. The revelation of Hawke's relationship with the United States was discussed by Dominic Sandbrook and Tom Holland in their history podcast The Rest is History and was likened to the activities of Jim Callaghan in the United Kingdom at the same time. Coventry gave a long-form interview for the Floodcast podcast on Hawke and the United States infiltration of the unions and ALP. Another podcast criticised Coventry for being overly cautious in his interview. The article was cited in David Day's 2024 biography of Hawke, \"Young Hawke: The Making of a Larrikin\".\nThe article was immediately censured by Hawke-Keating-era politicians. Stephen Loosely, who had been the ALP's national president during the early 1990s, said that the article was \"nonsense\" and \"For someone half a century later to label these people informants, when they can't defend themselves, simply doesn't hold water.\" An erstwhile Liberal politician, Paul Everingham (the Northern Territory's Chief Minister from 1978 to 1984), said that the informer argument was \"balls.\" Hawke's authorised biographer wrote that the label \"informant\" or \"spy\" was \"misleading\" because Hawke had a close relationship with British officials as well. An academic reviewer of Troy Bramston's biography of Hawke noted that Coventry's article was \"one of the few academic sources referenced by Bramston.\" Coventry's article was reviewed for the Melbourne Labour History Society by former secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall, Brian Boyd, which added further information about what was known of Hawke's US connections at the time.\nIn 2023, Coventry wrote an article on Hawke's famous world record beer skol (scull) in which he showed it to be \"apocryphal, possibly fabricated\". However, the record played a key part of Hawke's \"ocker chic\" (Australian machismo) image designed to appeal to Australian voters. Since the 1970s, ocker chic became the public relations model for Australian politicians. Since the 1980s middle-class masculinists have used ocker chic to reassert their power over Australian politics, economics, culture and society. Coventry received the John Barrett Award for this article in 2024. Commentary on the article in the press linked Hawke's dubious world record beer scull with other well-known but fabricated stories about him. The article as of January 2025 is on the all-time top 30 most read articles published in the \"Journal of Australian Studies\" (JAS). Day's biography of Hawke has since affirmed the evidential problems with the Hawke world record.\nPersonal life.\nAfter living in Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne, Ballarat and in New Zealand on the edge of Fiordland National Park, he now lives with his wife and three children in South London, United Kingdom.", "Julie Gilligan\n\nJulie Gilligan was an American Democratic politician from Lynn, Massachusetts.
